 Food's good but charge service fee using credit card which annoying. Otherwise best hard shell tacos had... Really! Hard shells really light thin but crispy. Very tasty. Pork best. Lunch specials pretty good . Always check see lunch special is. Haven't anything didn't like. meadow's mall family hungry decided grab something really quick. FYI Meadows mall across street spring preserves. really shocked well little tacos tasted.
I ordered 12 Tacos Carnitas pulled pork cheese guacamole.
The tacos diced onions cilantro just squeeze lime ... WOW dam good mall food. am sure would drive all way Henderson Taco would think though ... think gas Chevy Tahoe would cost more meal. If your mall some reason give try. think should ordered 4 more. 12 tacos shared 4. tacos self only $1.25 add cheese .25 cents guacamole another .25 cents. Man just writing review wants sneak off work grab bite. only speculate Tony's authentic Mexican Cuisine Which sounds funny because Tony think Italian know old joke... NY ... Anyhoot. far south yet. Tony's Taqueria Gringos guess? All stuff menu photographed translated into English. food flavorful relies food opposed being overpowered excess oil spices. 
 every table variety 3 different hot sauces waitstaff extremely nice pretty fast. Overall am exactly sure wanna come all over hit Mexican joint but if you're area most definitely worth trip. Mall food courts. known least parts haven exemplary eats....Most malls your basics covered chinese mexican pizza burgers on. 
Tony's however really step above average. food really really good. Ok don't own tortillas site big deal. food fresh prepared order best all dudes making food super nice customize just anything. 
I kind order off menu lot more careful order right double checking Sir don't want onions right? Why correct  man! selection lunch combo plate specials even prices pretty inexpensive. 
Sorry Hot Dog Stick sorry McCrappy's...Tony's gets money every time Trying find pair pants skipped dinner. seeing other options reading Dwayne's review choose Tony's.

I disappointed. Great customer service great tasting very flavorful dishes. expecting good Mexican dishes food court. 

I even back tipped them. Im cheap any means but outside coins change never tip food courts thinking its more fast food sit down but guys earned extra tip.
