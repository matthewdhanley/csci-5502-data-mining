 best calamari ever here.  Very friendly service.  Tons great burger choices.  Oyster awesome too. place terrible.  just arrived Vegas thinking eating Joe's Stone Crab Planet Hollywood.  Both packed but PJ Clarke's looked pretty empty.  looked Yelp found decent ratings decided give try.  

Considering place only few patrons mid week around 9pm thought would served immediately.  hostess nice brought table.  atmosphere seemed OK but wait ridiculous.  made eye contact 3 different waiters smiled assuming would come over help but just ignored us.  looked deliberate seemed come over but instead just kept talking.  couldn't believe it.

Now understand weren't dressed formally but wife mom just dressed casually khakis shirts nothing fancy but nothing bizarre .  seemed if being discriminated against whatever reason didn't even greet 20 minutes.  tried attention but just kept pretending ignore us.  fact even sure if just table next seemed getting pretty slow service well.  really strange because only two tables side establishment only 2 other tables occupied opposite side.  continued wait......and NOTHING!!!

We decided leave.  hostess approached asked happened told ignored nobody approached take order.  Again she nice tried call them but even took while just walked Planet Hollywood good meal good service .

Regardless going back PJ Clarke's again recommend nobody else does either. list 'burgers try' notes section phone slowly growing no idea where most them came from. Many recommendations readers while some articles local papers touting 'best unknown burger' something that. PJ Clarke's such place. didn't remember where suggestion came walking but waitress reminded Las Vegas Weekly claimed theirs 'best burger Las Vegas.' agree?

The answer no. burger definitely good but no way 'best' really hate claims this. won't into much history restaurant which dates back 1884 New York. read site without having repeat it. Vegas location located evil Forum Shops Caesar's Palace. say evil because if local ever tried park surely haven't forgotten awful experience. top off restaurant located Las Vegas Blvd end walk completely across mall through lumbering tourists smelly fountains.

For place supposedly Cadillac burgers burger section pretty minimal far down menu. aren't presented many options your 100% Black Angus burger just series cheeses few additional options fee bacon Béarnaise sauce fried egg etc. only pre configured burger menu predictably titled The Cadillac which smoked country bacon American cheese. Sides a la carte asked if wanted regular sweet potato fries it. course regular keep meal consistent possible others.

The burger came nice buttery grilled brioche bun two thick pieces bacon thin but tasty pickle slice tomatoes far much lettuce. wasn't until assembled burger picked did notice full slice onion hiding below. waitress later explained back day first restaurant New York served food paper plates way keep juices burger sogging plate. Nice touch tradition but kind odd.

The burger tastier anticipated first bite juicy bun good flavor cheese melted. meat its own ok kind generic meat flavor comes your standard Angus could maybe used little seasoning. ordered medium rare but bit grey middle compared friend's more pink mine only being ordered medium. burger dripped some juice during first few bites stopped maybe halfway through but luckily didn't really dry burger end. thing found odd during meal kept hitting weird pockets saltiness took bites. Initially thought might bacon but think just meat friend didn't bacon made same salt comment.

The bun well proportioned meat found just enough both. bacon slightly undercooked didn't quite crunch I'd hope but still very flavorful fit well. said cheese melted which still always easy some places but might contributed bit saltiness. fries might tiny bit undercooked but good flavor until cold which happened sort quickly. good 'natural' flavor much better attempted similar style somewhere Five Guys.

Now bad... say overall price meal little high due fact a la carte fries $6.60!! fine $14.60 burger based strip location even presented but fry price bit hand pushes burger past $20 which think bit high. service great think two different managers come table ask if everything ok. waitress Justina extremely friendly knew great deal history restaurant also provided onion explanation. All being said think $21 bit much burger unless maybe really 'best burger Vegas.' personally hate going strip days but if don't mind already find yourself Caesar's overall restaurant service food worth if you're willing cough bit much money sample supposedly best town. already know worse places strip. New York strip au poivre fantastic. Yukon mashed potatoes also really good. only knock P.J. Clarke's basically shopping mall Caesar's Palace. sat front which didn't help ambiance. advice ask sit far away hustle bustle tourists possible. used love PJ Clarke's New York where hamburgers transcendant.  Hamburgers quite match sure why but don't certain something ones New York did.  also bit overdone.  Fries tater tots excellent crispy though service great.

We back next day happy hour oysters FANTASTIC!  $1 each 2 45 6pm.  huge flavorful ended making early dinner them.  each 7 plus really delicious sidecar the drink special happy hour 2 1 pricing .  surprised sidecar thought it'd boozey but tasted great without bite alcohol.  bartender awesome.

We'll back happy hour sure! dinner Sunday night. Staff amazing ultimately great dinner.

As name suggests steak order. Anything else your own risk. Super fantastic. burger patty pink tasted deliscious. soft gooey bun little cheese compliment beef voila! love burger being LA some phenomenal burgers. must say seek burger when back Vegas. perfect taste beauty beef just magic simplicity. bar great beautiful oyster bar full menu but burger if aren't small eater normal woman especially if man order sides order two burgers because little small. give P.J. Clarkes Las Vegas Ceasar' Palace  star only because order lobster mac cheese really good otherwise deserves negative star if possible.

 am glad place now shows 3 dollar signs yelp because 2 time looked good reviews which main reason first place.

When visited July  place supposed close 12am when party 5 came 10.50 informed before even said many kitchen going close soon asked if  sure wanted come in.  enirely sure  good business but stupidly sat down anyway.  waiter started off pretty rude but started telling annoying group he waited before then nicer which understood but still care if other people suck its job cordial customers.  Then giving flat soda forgetting two times new drinks 15minutes waiting finally ordered.  Two orders Fish Chips lobster mac n cheese famous pj burger calamari.  ten minutes later waiter informed boyfriend run hamburger which think stupid restaurant do asked if he wanted anything else.  boyfriend ordered filet mignon neat waiter said he would ahead throw some fries inconvenience.  then he came back 3minutes say chef didnt want serve steak fries.  SERIOUSLY kind pretentious jerk says that? boyfriend asked talk chef if going problem but waiter quickly said he would take care it.  finally food.  somehow steak dry hell bland weird because ordered medium cooked.  everything else tasted pretty good problem both people ate fish chips ended runs defintiely anything else they'd eaten earlier.  just sucky experience. few times yelp really let down. OYSTER HAPPY HOUR  OYSTER UN HAPPY HOUR?

My favorite spreads above Atmosphere great!  Hamburger barely mediocre $17.60 plain one. Meat tasteless ball didn't fit bun well.  Fries good.   French onion soup hot enough wasn't brown crusty melted cheese too. Sweet.   Asked mayo Teaspoon no kidding.    Service greatest overall going back rated star especially since overpriced There's really nothing rave place except terrible service is. 

My husband mother in law really hungry because flight late wanted check something nice.  Caesar's Palace because short walking distance hotel.  Initially going Planet Hollywood except wait long figured should try something else.  Across Planet Hollywood Restaurant Joe's Stone Crab.  husband tried restaurant last time Vegas figured I'd check Yelp see other eateries plaza.  noticed P.J. Clarke's New York Chophouse 4 stars rating decided check out

As approached restaurant hostess really friendly over menu us.  moment pretty sold wanted try it.  She escorted table told servers would right us.  few minutes passed shocked none servers standing bar looking didn't seem acknowledge all.  made eye contact still NOTHING. 

We decided leave hostess asked wrong.  told none servers acknowledged us..  She looked shocked talk colleagues but stormed off decided spend money else where.

I really don't much tolerance rude people bad service never back here.  even look. Ryan oyster bar exceptional knowledge bivalves. BEST oysters strip. disappointed. last night special 99.00 dollars two. 16 oz steak two lobster tails salad dessert plus bottle wine. Service good food top notch came strictly $1 oyster happy hour. Boy good call part. sat oyster bar ate 2 dozen oysters day's happy hour special also tried 1 each other 4 varieties regular price $3 each. All oysters very fresh tasty. back when Vegas next time. server worst ever. Only saw twice throughout dinner. flag down 2nd time. He gave order oysters finished entrees. Oh food poisoning couldn't enjoy rest Vegas vacation. Amazingly cute little bar!!! wonderful time @ P.J's food amazing waiters ress very good bringing food everyone even made sure being 7 months pregnant given any sort seafood anything uncooked would come around ask husband if could eat very much appreciated!! 

Tho wish could drank amazing cocktails hubby drank enough them both! lol wanna say favorite boxcar... He just couldnt enough! 

The games trivia played fun!! boyfriend only quick pit stop while waiting shuttle but during brief half hour felt nothing but welcomed. fortunate enough come start happy hour roughly 2 45 3 00 p.m. able taste renown $1 oysters. yet acquire taste raw oysters but say bad all! only second time ever eating raw oyster even though tiny bit shell bite ALWAYS happens such horrible luck! enough want stay longer try more P. J. Clarke's food. boyfriend loved oysters he wishes more time hang order more. ate oysters bar bartender extremely friendly gregarious. happy go lucky attitude definitely rubbed off everyone seated bar. He also whipped boyfriend's special request drink  sprite mint leaves aka nonalcoholic mojito. 

Overall I'd say if you're looking kill some time grab quick cheap bite enjoy good company come down P.J. Clarke's happy hour! Seated 7 30 Sunday evening without waiting table. Stuck main course which 12oz Filet added Sautéed Button Mushrooms complement steak which worked perfectly. Awesome Steak! Ended meal Cheesecake which pretty tasty. highly recommend PJ Clarke's all. Happy Hour $1 oysters!!! can't find better place delicious oysters PJ Clarke's. servers fabulous extremely efficient. don't think water glass ever empty.  really way provide excellent service! host even pull your chair you. Ryan oyster bar entertaining knowledgeable. P.J.'s good little selection oysters both coasts allowing comparison. Carlsbad quite fresh splash saltwater. 
Crabcakes quite tasty appetizer although little small quite good didn't any nasty shells any other places. guessing main meal crabcakes little bit larger.
The price good considering location competition. couldn't every day but anyone Vegas constantly? food good. Tater tots very good oysters great. reason 2 stars service. waited over 45 minutes 6 oysters. waitress checked once initial ordering. saw multiple tables receive oysters seated us. Eventually manager brought oysters waitress finally coming back over saying wow oysters coming slow . If screwed didn't enter order just tell me. Don't try BS your manager front idiot. Honestly rarely complain service restaurants but awful. ask both hostess manager waitress. Even upon manager finding happened nothing done it. Truly atrocious service. Probably best steak ever eaten life. Good Atmosphere. Good service. TVS watch sports if needed... watched college football MLB playoffs while there. Great service food. lunch wife seated immediately. Split prawn cocktail huge prawns 4 cocktail sauce some kick it. Petit filet cooked sauced perfectly. Wife lobster BLT loved it. Maybe little generous but quality food very good. Bone Ribeye under seasoned but cooked perfectly good cut. Tasted Ahi steak wasabi potatoes all good.

Service slow fairly inattentive. Saturday night but seemed plenty staff but maybe not. restaurant 11 15 2012 6 05pm.  Did oysters happy hour review swayed everyone else's has.  First all service started off two seemingly capable waiters coming over introducing themselves.  While restaurant busy time somewhat obtrusively hovered 5 feet away multiple times asking if ready order.  finally tell them would let them know when ready.  service fine until place many more customers then hit miss getting attention.
    But far most disappointing experience evening why generously gave them 1 star.  other hand food even worthy dive bar.  Classic Caesar salad $9.90 chopped romaine salad dressing wouldn't even served bottle maybe but knows .  no real flavor Caesar dressing should ashamed serving it. 
    Next line 18oz. bone in Delmonico Ribeye $44.90 which two had.  When came 3 4 inch thick clearly weighing more 12 14 ounces.  also limp wet noodle outside barely showing any grill marks I guess because thin ordered medium rare couldn't leave grill long enough give some grill flavor .  didn't know yet small size would blessing.  serrated knives then began arduous process cutting into miserable waste beef.   excessive amount cartilage fat made task finding edible piece beef treasure hunt.  all said done would estimate between small size bone fat cartilage probably salvaged 6 ounces edible beef now see why glad its size .  payed almost $90 combined 12 ounces beef.
    Now understand steak going every now then may meet expectations but two them same table equally bad oversight.
   would recommend restaurant anybody but if planning having $45 ribeyes bring saw because serrated knife didn't cut. hubby came last week happy hour.  $1 Oysters can't beat. best deal going town. sat raw bar bartenders oyster shuckers very friendly provided wonderful service. PJ's offers different type oyster $1 special everyday week during happy hour which starts 2 45p.m. oysters half shell came iced platter 3 different condiments horseradish cocktail sauce sweet chili sauce also give cute little tobasco sauce tiny bottles. husband downed 2 dozen Oysters immediately.  regular price oysters $3 each great  value oyster lovers. Now if fan oysters may see value coming happy hour because everything else menu bit pricier side. Along oysters husband ordered each bowl clam chowder fried calamari.  love traditional new england clam chowder tasted took clam chowder tried evoke some gourmet into adding tasted some type wine. liked okay but wasn't enamored it. calamari wonderful! very tender nut rubbery when overcooked. clam chowder cost $8.50 $12.50 calamari. Wished special half price appetizers during happy hour. All all back if only oysters half shell wonderful service provide. hate going strip but if P.J. Clarke's don't mind. many times every time take someone new check out. love food service always great. Oyster Happy Hour best town especially quality oysters carry. definitely recommend eating even if  just looking cocktail small bite. P.J. Clarke's...my hats off you.  first YELP post just signed P.J. Clarke's inspiration!
I given task boss host 7 bigshots auto industry all SEMA.  dined P.J. Clarke's Wednesday October 31 8 30pm.  made reservations sat promptly beautiful hostess. While making reservation asked placed somewhere restaurant where may little less noisy talk perfect table.  guests easiest please asked server Damond please help look superstar boy did he come through.  Some guests liked oysters thats when Ryan oyster shucking Guru came opened eyes world oysters would think middle desert!  loved em fresh salty DELICIOUS.  assortment appetizers french onion soup some really good old school Cocktails zazerac first time hooked.  Most enjoyed Steak Lobster David  Lamb Chops loved them.  lobster tails cooked perfection Chef tops them off some sort crunchy topping which really set them apart form traditional just broiled boiled.  side dishes awesome Mac cheese peas bacon truffled mushroom rissoto very generous portions asparagus creamed spinach.  All desserts made kitchen scratch.  CINNAMON ice cream treat.  am scotch drinker but guests thought place ahad very good selection.  met managers Jason made sure guests good time he showed around restaurant even bathrooms show off HUGE urinals ice them gave some sort secret stash whiskey first time ever whiskey its bad anticipated.  way Myself David noticed $99 Steak Lobster dinner 2 came back last night try met Jason door he rememberd also met Rob another manager.  Service consistent crystal said she since beginning she really made night when she mentioned $99 dinner also included bottle wine!  kidding freaking bottle wine ribeye steak cooked perfectly way 2 lobster tails appetizers dessert $99 Vegas back first week december NYE see P.J. Clarke's again.  also gave shot glass remember them.  Thank keep good work P.J. Clarke's new favorite restaurant. $1 oysters during happy hour just A MAZING!!!!  Try earlier rather then later because ran before 6pm when last week.  But JB raw bar really nice hooked some cocktail shrimp sliders!  Ryan also shucking oysters very friendly professional.  P.J. Clarke's 2 nights row while Vegas. other night $99 deal 2.  steal!!!  picked ribeye flavorful tender. bottle wine came actually decent bread pudding EXCELLENT!!!  top off good food great service provided Doug. wish open P.J. Clarke's close me! place good.  Good food.  Good service.  Good good good but pretty nondescript me.  also really dead night ate which kind surreal when you're strip but imagine may bonus many. Loved every part meal. came during happy hour 3 6 ordered sliders $1.50 each oysters 1.00 each tuna tartar tacos. Everything delicious service good Prix Fixe Event Review We chose P.J. Clarke's host family member's 100th birthday.  
roughly 50 people attending chose prix fixe menu Sidecar room.  chose $45 per head menu included soup salad entree 4 family style sides dessert.

From beginning glitches.  called restaurant several 4 times set appointment discuss menu.  No returned calls despite direct promises call back.  point started reconsider choice.  However finally set something menu appointment.  staff very apologetic but still good start.

The day event restaurant really welcoming let set room prior event.  great having flexibility didn't feel pressured out.

Unfortunately when dinner started did problems.  main problem understaffed event.  2 4 servers working event but most just bringing food.  really hard refills silverware etc.

During dinner tomato soup which per contract include grilled cheese toast did arrive tables toast.  asked waitress she said bit attitude no told supposed come soup. clearly menus sitting every table.  then flag down night manager apologized handed toast everyone she really nice helpful . Sadly most people finished soup point. 

Then brought salads.  Many them didn't salad dressing once again waiters flagged down. Next brought entrees but didn't provide steak knives skirt steak.  Basic necessities hard come meal.

The family style sides really laughable though.  table 10 brought 20 tater tots share two tiny pots mushrooms and14 asparagus spears.  once again forgot french fries when those finally arrived consisted roughly two four handfuls table.  Really stingy opinion.  would preferred larger portions just two sides.

The dessert consisted cheesecake cobbler.  Two slices each per 10 person table. Yeah......

I really sidecar room think great spot host event.  main concern event service lack thereof.  really stressful keep running around hunting down staff fix basic issues issuing silverware providing salad dressing.  Also some staff weren't very friendly times saw them giving unwarranted attitude elderly guests.  bartender however awesome really nice everyone.

Overall food good but service lacking.  would probably return but only small dinner. fantastic Raw Bar Crisp Point Judith Calamari delicious. Today's Market Fish chef special salmon stuffed crab. Loved it. If you're ever Vegas try it. Instead ice cream served Crisco. took bite ice cream came cake asked server investigate happened.  Instead being apologetic embarrassed blithely stated run ice cream person plating desserts didn't know crisco wasn't ice cream. 5 hours being violently ill another phone call restaurant ended luke warm apology best. entire meals comped less. much incident way handled it. did care.  calling health department first thing morning. deal Vegas.com show dinner special. show absinthe before show husband showed reservation seated right away. server forgot name really nice sweet. Suggested couple drinks absinthe which bomb!!! Food uuuuhhhhmmmaaaaazzziiiinnng!!! ceasar salad good! crutons fresh! main course chicken pot pie hubby steak frite! oh good  tooo! last but least bread pudding die for!!!! Oysters good too.

I highly recommend place! definitely back! 3.5 Stars

$1 Oysters @ happy hour daily 2 45 6pm. ordered 2 dozen happy hour oysters few others regular menu $3 each. happy hour oysters excellent. other ones bad  . . just little pricey. wish served more lemons platter oysters since little bit more lemon oysters. service could little better though but hey  . . . $1 oysters  . . . expect right? Great place.  Definitely 99 prix fixe menu.  Plenty good food great price.  2 salads 2 crab cakes 40oz steak 2 desserts bottle wine.  wine ok everything else excellent.  Difficult end Caesars mall but worth walk. server Chuck great.  started Aviation cocktail Rhode Island calamari loved both.  guess some people don't floral aspect cocktail server hung around while sampled sure going something really appreciate.
My calamari perfectly cooked served dipping sauce pickled peppers just right spice level.  hot all just nicely flavorful.  portion generous would happy come back again dish maybe just another app.
For entree ordered steak frites which 10 oz skirt steak cut meat really love.  All steaks came your choice sauce selected au poivre but wish hadn't.  steak cooked ordered but sauce liking.  steak au poivre before but lacking distinctive pepper flavor instead being able taste cream cognac more beef gravy like flavor wasn't very good.  fries OK.
After two generous dishes did room dessert but don't feel though missing anything.  selections very humdrum bread pudding cheesecake ice cream etc.
Still would back just great cocktail calamari. Best secret Vegas. No need STK Craftsteak Strip House. chop house should be. pit stop long here. Great food! Great service! Amazing!

I came 3 times far each time impress quality food service. 

I really enjoy happy hour menu which every day 3 6. $1 oyster best menu. enjoy oyster bar table but bar watch them shuck them ease. 

I also $99 menu which included appetizer soup salad main course dessert....and cannot forget WHOLE bottle wine your choice.  price meal fed 3 people easy...

This place know stoping when head into Vegas. Awwww Shucks  guys Ryan tattoo sleeve dude Eric quiet but efficient best shuckers town! oysters FRESH if afternoon they're only $1 piece for ones special . But sure taste all sitting behind knowledgeable guys ice awesome taste around world! Came last sat night seated right away.  French onion soup great oysters great filet Oscar style delish. Gotta love waiter Matt made night really fun he hilarious!  sat front fab time! Excellent service good value money.  food excellent especially price. saw place previous trip Vegas recognized name trips NY. place wasn't very busy but day 4th July Tuesday. seated promptly outside area inside Forum Shops. great view constant mob humanity parading Forum. waiter friendly efficient willing suggestions. wife enjoyed wedge salads cold crisp lettuce bacon blue cheese chunks blue cheese dressing. wife French Onion soup enjoyed hint sherry broth. Skirt Steak shoestring potatoes 10 ounce portion cooked medium rare requested served generous portion crispy shoestring potatoes herbed butter at waiters suggestion perfect. whole experience very relaxed pleasant entertaining. Put word folks place really pretty good. gonna blow away but ain't gonna break bank either. reeeally love oysters half shell.  When walked place saw sign Happy Hour knew come back $1 oysters half shell. Chilled Iced Oysters Half Shell dollar everyday 3 6PM.They also other bar food HH prices Crisp Point Judith Calamari Tuna Tartare Tacos Ribeye Steak Sliders...but just decided stuff myself oysters.

I walked around forum shops headed back over 3pm when happy hour started.  ordered dozen Fear Loathing cocktail.  oysters really fresh delicious light snack...I actually just eaten Max Brenner still full but just couldn't resist $1 oysters.  LOVE happy hour! Everytime feel getting good deal just it!

Since only oysters cocktail review isn't representative rest food serve.  server nice he shucking oysters.  

The Fear Loathing tough cocktail drink.  those types cocktails strong easy palate. finish take gulps time. wasn't pleasant. 

The Fear Loathing PJ Clarke's version classic long island iced tea spiked absinthe energy.   guess more intrigued absinthe energy but pretty dissappointed.  wasn't pleasant.  made even more dissappointing $15.  would rather spent those $15 Fat Tuesdays any other beverage matter.  live learn guess! on the fly review based happy hour only. $1 Oysters $3 beers pretty much enough keep happy themselves but add super friendly bartenders big kudo's Smitty  can't recall last time bartender shook hand personally introduced himself cool old time steakhouse atmosphere definitely back! Since didn't eat off full menu order any specialty drinks can't 5 stars overall but doing did very well highly recommend PJ's. place great! cheap but wallet killer. Except 120 couple if food drink two. hamburger fries because supposedly 2011 best hamburger Vegas...and eating would doubt voted best. amazing. All friends ordered variety food raved picks. 

The vibe similar high end Kings fish house darker lighting. Way cool bar set too. happy hour oysters 1$ea totally rock. $1 Oysters HH! Daily before 6pm.

My girls stepped last night Vegas dinner. Yes PJ Clarke's NYC but drunk full Fat Tuesday yards lazy move seats front fountain Caesar's whatevs!

Our waiter great! moment sat down yards he looked said guess won't needing drink menu! Love he didn't try scam into buying more drinks..because drunken stupor probably would have. 

For group 8 ordered 3dz oysters. Three girls split 2 crab cakes + another girl ordered brussel sprouts. tried bite crab cakes nice full meat. oysters pretty big fleshy only downside quite fishy doused lemon cocktail sauce edible.

At end meal waiter came around free shots birthday girl! mentioned birthday when initially sat down didn't think much but waiter remembered! He also nice green flower bad she's allergic... . Awesome service! walked immediately table since super slow. waiter didn't know much menu he took order took 1 2hr few reminders until he gave salads food which just 4 hamburgers came 1hr. upset leave place. told took long bring order instead apologizing he said marry Christmas! which very sarcastic. food great plus when check found fries separate charge. $14 burger came cost $30 each which worth it. disappointed. never going back there. friends come day before mentioned wanted oyster bars too.. brought back round two next day.

$1 happy hour Oysters 2 45 6 00pm.  

We came around 4ish.. seated quickly.. however seated behind pillar thing hard flag anyone down... 15 20 minutes finally someone's attention apparently middle shift change he wasn't aware he table serve.  Once he finally acknowledged service great.  ordered 4 dozen oysters 2 ultimate bloody marys.

The oysters fresh delicious.. some some small side.. some where shells oysters hurt teeth when accidentally bit down it.  also oysters plenty lemon juice platter dozen comes lemon.  server very kind bring another plate lemons.

The ultimate bloody mary actually tastes pretty goood for someone doesn't tomato juice tried wasn't revolted it.  does cost $15 each.. would rather 15 oysters over bloody mary but hey vegas drinks steep people come drink.

The mint eating bunch oysters also plus.  

When vegas looking good oysters good price back. came just $1 oysters completely disappointed.  Tiny grainy. worth city much delicious food! came because grandma taste lobster all other restaurants Cesar's wait sign right outside said 1 lb Maine lobster $48.  She 1 lb lobster 8 oz filet lobster tail.  also crab cake appetizer.  crab cake pretty small $16 meat just ok grandma said tasted she gets pouch store.  agreed best part crust top.  worth $16.  lobsters all overcooked don't think 8 oz.  filet undercooked more rare medium rare flavor just ok.  $130 very mediocre food.  service good though staff pretty friendly.  forgot purse right back 5 minutes later but already back took them 10 minutes strange.

I would try place happy hour but never anything else. originally job haha. learned extremely friendly cheerful staff is. Granted did no hired their loss there's always next time! back follow status decided eat little something. absolutely adore atmosphere! very Irish pub LOVE! menu amazing. Since own decided order appetizer soup. sat gorgeous bar met Woody another Las Vegas native! Wow! First came French onion soup. arrived piping hot gooey Swiss cheese. PERFECT!  Next came  Crisp Parmesan tater tots roast red pepper aioli! Yup said tater tots! texture Ore Ida!!! smooth inside crispy outside. bell pepper fan unless red bell...and aioli red bell it! different. first said 'What the...' then ALLLLL RIIIIIGHT! taking brother pastrami myself try oysters next. can't wait!!!
I don't think cater but host parties! yay! really good Twin Lobster deal 2 tails 45. The lobster succulent well prepared. green butter tasty but imho suitable sweetness lobster. mashed potatoes bleh tasted made flakes.

In middle meal family crying baby came in. don't restaurants hear crying babies. fact why would bring your baby Vegas?

The service great though no cause complaint.

But babies. Babies don't belong restaurants. Located new section Forum Shops Caesars Palace P. J. Clarke's seafood restaurant features $1 oysters half shell during happy hour.

If you're oyster lover your oasis. $1 happy hour oysters shucked right before your eyes they're shucked right place your order second before. 

Obviously aren't absolute best oysters money buy but $1 they're beyond worth it. If lived area I'd least once week.

I also tried Tuna Tartare Tacos. While weren't bad all wouldn't order them again. They're cute tiny little tacos. mean less bite size. something Dr. Seuss book. shells much flavor themselves took away tuna.

The service great ambiance terrific. only wish bar area bit bigger tad cramped sitting between patrons.

Again if oysters place must!

Food 4
Ambience 4
Service 4
Value 5 Great service inventive drinks ample amount food. Loved $1 oyster 3 6 pm. Oysters $1 happy hours 3 6 nobody complain best deal Las Vegas.
Fresh Sea food millions miles ocean.
And lots other good food excellent service very nice stuf.
Will come back sure. Arrived 10 minutes early reservation 5 people but seated 25 minutes most night service slow.  down side upside food great.  Split strip steak salmon. both great quality cooked well.  Someone else party seafood hot pot outstanding.  little pricey but reasonable against Las Vegas prices. Fresh Oysters best during Happy Hour here....99 cents oysters during happy hour! WOW...That's Vegas! decided last night Vegas should nice dinner steakhouse. being familiar area checked yelp. chose P.J. Clarke's because good reviews reasonable prices. steakhouse you're going pay good amount but comparison pretty reasonable.

The thing bugged most seated patio section which isn't really patio all. Part restaurant juts into Forum Shops mall. very much having romantic evening Vegas inside mall.

The food good but next time would definitely skip macaroni cheese. expecting baked dish but more noodles alfredo sauce breadcrumbs sprinkled top. organized UYE hang fellow Yelpers Jade boyfriend Scott Kevin Molly Julia briefly Anthony. company definitely great.

We HH which offered $1 Oysters 3pm 6pm reduced prices appetizers beer buy cocktail day. Since organized event able take advantage HH items table instead bar. started off half dozen Crystal Pointe oysters. tasted incredibly fresh knew six would enough. Next dozen oysters California oysters but don't remember variety name. large meaty filling. Very delicious fresh. provided Tabasco  sauce addition mignonette cocktail horseradish sauces. 

I also Cod Bites picture provided which $9.50 two decently sized pieces battered cod. perfectly cooked great flavor. also offered $1.50 sliders well. 

The food oysters fantastic. such amazing deal FRESH high quality oysters. 

The server friendly accommodating. only bummer cocktail day...it just  vodka cranberry. Worst service food comes cold. place good? Yes. 

Are lot better places? Yes!

I dinner ordered Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail Shrimp Spring Rolls appetizers. shrimp cocktail exactly expected cold shrimp cocktail sauce.The spring rolls actually really good if came back would start meal off order these.

For main course Crown Cut Bone Filet Mignon 12 oz. steak really didn't much me. price point almost anywhere else better steak.

Next time if forum shops looking steak probably next door Joes. Came 01 25 2013 birthday dinner.  Service point let loud silly very accommodating group.
Food WAY overpriced quality beef.  don't mind paying $50 steak but better melt your mouth.  literally saw through meat chewing project too.
Again..the service great just food wasn't hot.
The happy hour oysters great deal fresh if ever come back all would for.  happy hour oysters skip steak. two star rating mainly result price taste portion size. rarely eat high end restaurants when expectations high. initially disappointed when told while Caesar salad dressing evidently made fresh couldn't modified accommodate request no anchovies. Fine ordered anyway. When came surprised such small portion. tasted okay but better salads less half price. husband impressed salad either. entree salmon. Again okay but great lacked flavor. husband steak dry flavorless shocked due price. Nearly $100 2 salads 2 entrees no drinks just worth it. Needless say won't going back. Vegas SEVEN Magazine Article Reads ..fresh coarse French grind Meyer Ranch Red Angus beef..intensely beefy taste. Geeeez sold! 'The Cadillac' Smoked Country Bacon American plus side Bearnaise sauce gonna simple but cravin' bacon. burger came just described except tucked away onion slices underneath burger.. Yeah if want then pull add please never seen before . burger Phenomenal! Definitely Top 3 Vegas thus far.. burger Perfectly Seasoned mean another dash salt would much.. Meat just sang taste buds Beef Flavor Reckoned with! Nice couple thick strips meaty crunchy bacon Excellent Cheese just Brought some Wholesome Creaminess! Bearnaise sauce Just forget it!! love bearnaise sauce rendition mouth watering! Burger + Bearnaise Sauce = Worth Crying Over!! Crisp Parmesan Tater Tots Tomato Jam Only 8 pieces normal sized Tater Tots dip.. Tots okay heavy compacted I'd take Sonics airy crispy salty tots anyday over one . dip kinda sweet didn't care much.. love Tots but didn't deliver opinion. mention almost $9 Bucks!!

Located end Forum shops Las Vegas Blvd. Side . If your just aiming dine may want park Valet located end hotel your gonna hike bit maybe good idea considering calories packed meal . Server Bartender real mellow composed Atmosphere kinda pub Burger Vegas Treasure!!!!! valentines day dinner.

Though prix fixed menu occasion opted regular menu. both ordered steaks primerib she strip steak both very good very large. barely finished mine she only ate half hers. also crab cake appetizer though small price very very good. sauce crab meat which real no imitation delicious.

The decor great looks classy restaurant bar front hear great happy hours. service great did feel rushed food didnt take long. He very nice but feeling he couldve better. He gave hearty thank once left good tip though yeah. Take will. review only regarding oyster happy hour which 6 times last couple years... last two years changed days hours drinks food happy but thing remains same. Great 1$ oysters which never disappoint.

We also love service bar. Shout out Ryan oyster bar great shucker really nice guy! nice see same faces oyster bar every time go. feel regulars even though live Albuquerque. 

Right now also 3$  drafts 2 1 cocktails some cute looking sliders. well some other little food items. seem revamping image working now oyster bar lot more crowded used .  always keep returning here!! PJ's hands down best food best price Forum Shop employees. When first started working mall dreaded having buy lunch if didn't time pack one. PJ's special menu mall employees best all deliver free! just added some new items menu summer but favorite thing order grilled chicken sandwich bleu cheese. only $7 bag chips cookie too. would give them 5 stars but couple occasions where forgot include things order charging bleu cheese but putting any sandwich forgetting include lettuce tomato onions. All around though very satisfied food. Oh delivery girl hot  always plus charge making reservation friend's 40th birthday chose PJ Clarks reading reviews Open Table Yelp. sorry say chose poorly. 
The tater tots appetizers nothing write home about.  calamari decent but better.  

The wedge salad good French onion soup. 

One guest's lobster undercooked while ribeye more medium well medium rare not ok given price . filet mignon very good according two people ordered but supposed Au Poivre wasn't brought sauce ? guest already finished steak. 

I mentioned 40th birthday celebration when made reservation but didn't acknowledge it. 

Give shot if want based other reviews maybe just having off night when there.  Chuck server great! Located Forum Shops Caesar's Palace same floor very close Joe's Stone Crab.

Came lunch Tuesday.  Place EMPTY!!!  didn't know if open not!

Sat immediately ordered Fish Chips New England Haddock IPA Remoulade $19.95.

You HUGE piece fish fries DELICIOUS IPA Remoulade!  could eaten more that!!

The fish delicious flaky fries yummy.  would totally head back again! Tried T bone steak fatty juicy steak just way wanted tonight.  late happy hour $1 oysters but server kind ask manager if could oysters $1 he said YES made night much more fun enjoyable. Tater totts just OK... no kids menu.. Waiter seemed own world wasn't really there. burger bad great tho. better burger Bachi burger off strip. fantastic lunch today.  bottle Cakebread chardonnay wedge salad incredible blue cheese dressing creamy clam chowder amazing Vermont Cheddar Burger soft bun world.   brought back lot fond memories when lived Chicago right next door PJ Clarke's North State Parkway.  Thanks memorable lunch.  back because can't wait try your oyster selections. sat oyster bar boyfriend loves oysters.  young kid behind bar Mr. upsell upselling amount oysters type champagne wanted etc.  non stop.  stayed 30 minutes ate half oysters Joe's across way.  No class vs. class.  ended having great evening. Burger delicious! But really $15 worth burger. Fries definitely weren't worth $6. baked squash.. Better bang buck.  Apparently $1 oysters happy hour but nothing else. But if you're looking good burger definitely worth stop if budget it . review happy hour.

The Skinny poor execution American Classics but still edible... guess 3 service okay bar bartender's attention quite few times though 2.5 value price paid you'd lot better elsewhere 2.5 The hubs schlep down Forum Shops because shopping errand mom. While decided hit P.J. Clarke's happy hour. 

Just preface don't indulge oysters if you're interested $1 oyster thing review might apply you. ordered buffalo chicken lettuce wraps $7.90 crispy cod pieces $9.50 slider $1.50 baked macaroni cheese $6.10 .

I'd say definitely pass slider. little meat burger under seasoned. bun unfortunately hard unpleasant texture. bite left remaining bread alone.

The buffalo chicken lettuce wraps odd. guess if looking lighter alternative buffalo chicken wings then perhaps might appeal. However if throw blue cheese dressing might wash. buffalo chicken wraps essentially diced pieces chicken breast grilled sauteed drenched buffalo wing sauce then served lettuce pickled cucumber some carrot curls. Decidedly meh... if you're craving buffalo chicken wings poor substitute. texture chicken overly firm despite dicing. Although pickled cucumbers okay whole plate needed more carrot addition celery cut through heat. blue cheese dressing overly blue cheesy solid.

Baked macaroni cheese bacon peas okay. cheese sauce overly thick gumming pasta shells together unpleasant texture. flavor balance dish wasn't quite right little much bacon enough cheese. serving size cost I'd skip too.

The best thing definitely fried cod pieces. batter light held well together fish. tartar sauce good but spectacular requiring perhaps little more acidity more interesting. being said could probably something much better price elsewhere.

Of note did sit next couple ordered chef's happy hour special day which ahi tuna tacos. say embarrassing. tuna tacos size taco made Smurf FYI smurfs 3 apples tall . think could fit all six tacos palm hand consumed bite. Although did try item myself given portion size would highly recommend against ordering this. Unless high roller Smurf money burn in. All all meal set back $30 which expensive happy hour specials. Although food indeed edible probably between level 2.5 3 star value your money just isn't there. overall I'd say 2.5 stars rounded down 2 when factor cost. Avoid if you're interested oysters drink specials. 2 starred review. Service sweet but better seasoned flavored steaks. share steak salad side dessert good deal $99 though included half bottle merlot cab place cheapest happy hour oysters city.  3 6 pm everyday think $1 each!  different types depending what's available.  Certain drinks also half off.  aren't any other happy hour food specials but some other bar food order.  beef dip sliders came two per order calamari.  dozen oysters Newcastle each actually really full.  serving calamari huge couldn't finish it.  oysters come cocktail sauce straight horseradish mignonette sauce.

I glanced rest menu kinda pricey.  Overall satisfied.  only thing place all way end Forum Shops if you're wearing heels long walk.  end mall curved escalators.  If walking entrance directly Strip but if parked structure prepared walk.

ETA Thanks Nik O. tip valet side Joe's Stone Crab if don't wanna walk. came support friend Terri R birthday!  Along couple other friends yelpers. Most part think all first time let yelping begin. Lol! Honestly first impressions total New York vibe first step walk into restaurant even exterior design. felt going into basement someplace dark dinner because times felt needed more lighting just read menu. whole service staff traditional white collar shirts black tie black apron. Really style see high end steak house New York. all pictures hanging walls different perspectives city white paper instead tablecloth. daily specials written different parts walls chalkboard style. If want New York State mind restaurant vibe.

The food since big party ordered few different apps try parmesan potatoes sure exact name calamari one hot peppers without . parmesan potatoes really good! balance between cheese potatoes neither dominated other flavor wise. Nice crispy outside hot moist inside! presentation give props small cast iron skillet enough fit six perfectly. calamari enjoyed both them. enjoy spicy food prefer ones hot peppers. Spice level nothing but still little extra something added depth flavor. nice size portion golden crispy outside nice tartar sauce came compliment dipping sauce. 

I clam chowder start meal. solid nothing brag but soup order again heart beat. entree ordered fish chips. LOVED batter fish fried in. beer batter but also used nice IPA beer. nice golden crispy slightly darker side thinking maybe IPA just cheap beer. Yet heavy heavy batter still light once break crust fish steaming hot moist. fish size monster piece. covers plate top bed skinny fries. shoe strings fries nothing special. lot food. Bargain. 

Most people come HH. noticed menu dollar oysters star show but other things HH menu too. If look regular menu prices HH might best route go. could see myself coming back HH. Pretty tasty food! Cadillac hamburger $17.90 really good!  husband asked share actually brought cut half two plates.  nice!  parmesan tater tots $9.90 also pretty amazing.  also selection east west coast oysters $32 which nice number oysters.  Some little grainy but others quite creamy delicious.  Ask server recommend best oysters just those.

The servers very attentive.  located far back section Forum Shops near entrance strip.  If park Caesars pretty long walk.

The restaurant private room back called Sidecar.  If ask Sidecar membership it's free! free access room.  Great large groups private dinner. no extra charge unless ask special catering.  If chance use re review. Carlos great server point.  came boyfriends birthday.  East coast oysters wasn't fond of.  fries bit salty.  did request truffle oil.  gave large side $3.  clam chowder good.  also little neck clams shrimp cocktail drinks.  total came $89. am  very picky when order server patient accommodating.  boyfriend enjoyed it.  coming back $99 special. having surprisingly profitable weekend gambling looking nice meal celebrate while burning through all gambling profits. settled P.J. Clarke's quite happy choice. filet perfectly cooked immaculately flavored.  Could asked more steak. buddy ordered appetizer Crisp Parmesan Tater Tots. gave funky look given price fact he ordered tater tots steakhouse but turns serve side crow. amazing!  top waitress flawless entire duration meal. Could asked better experience. fish fish chips buttery flaky tender. best ive anywhere. Oysters fresh but worth regular price try during happy hour $1 each but drinks $11 cheap wine service tends slow down during happy hour bar should designated waiter waitress feel sorry oyster shuckers trying multi task although supervisors helping out
once while warning soda price $4 rip off. $1 oysters!!!!!!!!! Gotta love them JUST special. experience would perfect if server mmm bit more experience. don't want say he horrible just.. kind unprofessional BUT he cool guy lol .Took off corkage fee woooot $25 corkage.. ridick.. but anyways ordered 2 dozen oysters few sliders..

Bartender Tim amazing dude. definitely stopping every day 2 45 6 whenever Vegas! Good food but lost stars bad service. 

$1 oysters happy hour omgah Vegas really paradise lol. table 53 all together good but some kinda small. No biggie still satisfied 

My friends ordered calamari pretty bomb. But should $12.00 hahah sauce amazing ! 

We ordered 3 $1.50 beef sliders waiter brought four. told only ordered three server Amanda came gave much attitude saying only ordered three? could've sworn said four rolled eyes walked away. friend coming bathroom said she saw throwing dish down back all angry stuff.. Total turn off. seriously? unprofessional. Buzz kill sure. Thanks Elisa C. tip $1 happy hour oysters. 3 6pm every day umm YEAH bad all.

At $1 oyster getting quality stuff.  Fresh oysters new type oyster every day.  don't know Washington Shuckums something that? way amazing worth every penny.

I'd skip food drinks just oysters here.  also ordered Parmesan Tater Tots weren't special  not worth money.  8 people party given just 8 tater tots dividing $1 person tater tot could've 8 more oysters!

Elisa C. raved mussels which didn't see menu  shame since she REALLY REALLY raved them.

Our servers kind herp derp.  seated took drink orders nervous first day but he did fine.  just wanted water didn't things hard him.  main server seemed fluster most time all over place.  Still good dining experience though just oysters happy. Cool relaxing place grab beer cider Caesars.  atmosphere nice...love tile floors.  service friendly too! Definitely worth going during happy hour. $1 oysters probably best bloody marys had. $1 fresh oysters.

That's right FRESH delicious $1 oysters shucked front very hardworking sweet server sit enjoying your cheap beer other happy hour tidings. three dozen probably could done four but dinner plans later. Wut wut know! two kinds while North Point something east coast. don't remember because busy drowning oysters horseradish vinegarette. Mmmm...

There also other munchies available $1.50 sliders juicy minature patties toasted buns fried cod fish think fish chips but minus fries . 

Skip ahi tuna. Sizing hilarious looked children's playset little taco shells only Barbie would consider right size. Taste non existent because time your mouth couldn't find anymore.

1 small dash scant drop Angostura bitters extremely optional some feel helps open flavors but traditionalists may leave out .
2 ounces rye whiskey.
Strip lemon peel really impressed.  looked could really cool place eat little disappointed.

We food ordered bar.  bartender wasn't least bit friendly.  He seemed irritated all.  He however very nice when he told needed move.  

The burger ordered alright kind gave eating it...it put together yourself ingredients gave weren't cooperating each other.  ended covered ketchup least half burger uneaten.  fries soggy maybe light rinse before thrown box.

The clam chowder really good though.  But don't know if  even saying much pretty sure nobody soup scratch days.

I may venture back $1 oysters though.  Maybe. Wine selection very average decided beer.   Glass beer smelled strongly bleach bartender annoyed when asked new glass.   WTH? only dined once can't give 5 stars yet but place great!  Service just fine attentive friendly.  oysters some best ever lots juice!  mushroom risotto delish big fresh cut mushrooms.  All all awesome definitely back! Great food LOVE OYSTERS FRESHLY SHUCKED. $1 too? GOOD TRUE... MMMM  sliders pretty bomb ONLY $1.50?! Medium rare goodness.

Starters tuna tar tar mini tacos bit small fill taste buds but pretty tastey

brocolli cheese dip deliciouse especially getting some burnt cheesy parts eat tortilla chips


Salads Ceasar salads bit upset wasn't anything unusual but good croutons tasted made fresh. 

Tomato Onion Mozerella Chesse Cheese rich almost tasted nothing but melted mouth. Perfect combo tomato onions drizzled sweet balsamic vinegar. 

Dinner Cheese burgers fan choice but meat very tender 

Fish Sticks way many fries compared fish but fish tasted yummy. 

Chicken Pot Pie favorite dinner dish. think would taste fine without chicken being vegetarian fan but admit chicken good made think grandma. haha! 

Desert Chocolate Cake Way sweet taste buds but definitely rich if chocolate lover must have.

New York Cheese cake Delicious love cheese cakes desert finished first table. 

Other food Service AWESOME.. best servers managers encountered strip. Definitely want come back enjoy good time.

Service incredibly attentive overall great experience. Oyster Bar Review Catch $1 Oysters P.J. Clarke's afternoon happy hour everyday 3pm 6pm.  afternoon shopping Forums decided treat myself dozen beauties Oyster Bar.  Ryan shucker station super friendly chatted stuffed face Skookum oysters.  Each day highlights different oyster happy hour special some Washington British Columbia California.  oysters incredibly fresh plump certainly don't skimp choices.  Sitting oyster bar fun way see shucking take place chat other oyster lovers.  While didn't stay dinner menu offers array steak seafood soups good cocktail drinks list.  If oyster bar experience any indication rest establishment would definitely want come back.  restaurant just opened earlier year they based primarily New York City looking forward hearing more buzz place. P.J. Clarke's bookmarked really long time when Forum Shops usually eat Joe's but hearing much $1 oysters during happy hour finally decided walk passed Joe's give them try. sat bar started order James River oysters Luna I can't remember which offered during happy hour serve both East West Coast bartender kept stressing only offered during happy hour. kept telling ok paying regular price oysters . When oysters arrived looked decent but taste fell short anything I'd crave. wasn't impressed. ordered Moscow Mule really bad. don't know if ginger beer if he added something isn't supposed sure mess drink. Anyways left Joe's real Kusshi oysters. don't see place stayed opened. Maybe surivive crappy hour. Came birthday dinner. fabulous! Food excellent. gave ladies champagne house. Service perfect. Couldn't better! came $1 oysters during happy hour 4pm 6pm very happy food. 
Oysters very fresh
Parmesan Tater Tots good!
Crab Cakes also very good very little fillers primarily lump crab meat inside. 
Tuna Tartare Tacos good but portions little small liking
Calamari very good breading calamri. good dipping sauce

would back more Food average. Steak little tough bread before appetizer seemed little cheap. warm apple cobbler cold . did enjoy wedge salad. Probably won't back unless free. favorite happy hour oysters cocktails! 

Yes strip but if down any other reason worthwhile!  come locals starter night.  Happy hour oysters 4 till 6 choice best ones bunch but never disappointed. oysters always fresh smooth taste prefer Briny Mild sweet salty tasting oysters.  Always seem lucky getting them here!  other great thing happy hour drink specials.  When come happy hour must sit bar sometimes neglected but bartenders specialty martini cosmos drink choice worth extra money spot! 

This review purely happy hour food drinks yet taste main menu! Wir waren jetzt schon 2. Mal da innerhalb von 3. Jahren.  Immer war das Essen von bester Qualität und sehr sorgfältig zubereitet. Eine Freude sind auch die gut geschulten und freundlichen Kellner. Der Laden ist auch optisch ganz nach unserem Geschmack. Super tolle Bar wie im alten N.Y. und auch gemütliche Tische für kleine und große Zusammenkünfte. Wir lieben es !!
p. s. das Preisniveau ist angemessen wie wir finden Vegas best bar $1 oyster happy hour. Perhaps best Bloody Mary ever small fish bowl colossal shrimp side. bar old school great professional bar keeps. Visit almost every afternoon Vegas trip missed. Also great burger actually cook medium rare burger.  guys know doing! Also back glass bar actually 12 ft wide tv. am huge fan place great oysters great steaks great vibes young hip crowd few richies mixed in.   5 star food service! ordered basics Blue Wedge Ribeye sides asparagus Baked Mac Cheese creamed spinach.  service very friendly but very able.  starving quickly ordered salads bread.  said would bring bread first bread bread Bueller Bueller anyone?  did down hill nor did better just consistently mediocre.  bring salad still waiting bread come around give steak knives then walk around table two times then walk away without leaving knives.  finish salads right bring bread.  take away plates wait steaks.  ordered Ribeye Porterhouse filet.  steaks come no sides.  Oh remember question steak knives if waiter should place them table...not only steak knives no flatware flatware left dirty salad plates just should but replaced until asked well steaks arrived.  Oh sides.... eventually showed up.  let's talk food.  ribeye fantastic flavor though little over done ordered medium rare turned medium enjoying first half until closer bone when medium turned into medium well.  Now please understand steaks continue cook remove them heat if would able eat steak when came perhaps would okay but remember earlier when said steaks but no flatware may made all difference done steak was.  just left second half uneaten paid bill left.  $200 bill three steaks salads sides but no alcohol.  worst dining experiences price point ever just skating edge whole way never bad enough really complain but just bad enough enjoyable meal.

No reason turn way hope management reads addresses issues. initially found place cab driver. He told owner spent 8 million dollars building restaurant check out. 

This place knows burger right! When say medium rare actually see taste difference

I The Cadillac Smoked Country Bacon American swiss cheese sauteed mushrooms 

I also tried tater tots sweet potato fries pesto chicken sandwich which all very good.

Service sucked slow. should thought many people would come place when freakin' three day weekend! Yes maybe some people don't day off Veterans day but think people DOES! Ugh

Came coworkers thought it'll nice eat some daily $1 oysters eating small dish. hell wait when ordered food. server short hair puts bun side sucked serving us. mean know busy but she did say much sorry wait ever. Waited 40 mins food then another 40 dozens oysters. looked over oyster bar only person shucking.. maybe they'll more money if more two people shucking??? freak man more customers = more employees should working! Come now!

At end let waitress know just want half dozen because taking forever. She tells 'Oh check them see if already put dozens start yet. line orders working on. Bare we're busy today' freak lady... more try your customer happy wait long. Because co worker already said sorry leaving no tip. Boy did co worker made obvious. Took bill worker said 'bring your manager's attention.' oysters but didn't good service. Bleh if youre staying caesars palace wanna dine prepared long ass walk.
$1 oysters wkday  h.h

Went late Saturday afternoon lunch sat down immediately. actually Saturday before Superbowl waiters waitresses talking place gets crowded popular watch game since wall TV's set restaurant. 

The service great. food even better. 

I ordered Roast Free Range Turkey Club Smoked Bacon personally don't chibata bread all much because little tougher handle but sandwich lot flavor plenty chewable. 

They're known burgers which bite which A+ The Cadillac Burger Smoked country bacon American. Added swiss cheese sauteed mushrooms. juicest well cooked burgers yet. 

For less expensive but better food Vegas definitely check P.J. Clarke's!! Oyster Bar Happy Hour worth it. 

Beers solid selection

Steak just it.

Location pretty much center strip 45 second walk your chair always enjoyed stroll through forum shops cool down gawk stuff cannot afford. 

Bring girl girls love oysters. forum mall very nice atmosphere. outstanding service. caprese salad very good. steak however grossly over salted served mountain mediocre fries. peppercorn sauce distinctly lacked any pepper flavor showed no evidence key ingredient. burger very good but undercooked. Repeated visit last trip Vegas ran oysters before 4pm! waiter didn't know happy hour special cocktail. m split going give them another try some point.  burger heard very small came open faced dry  plain small bun veggies toothpicked together side condiments table. UGH! HATE assembling food restaurant. If want dinner stay home. meat fine cooked ordered but bun fell apart 3 bites. manager asked was. said bullsh** told disappointed it. He took off check without asking which appreciate. started caesar salad which great better ones recent memory. service good friendly helpful. Couldn't ask better service. $17 burger huge disappointment. try them again. menu looks great. best room eat solo bar huge TVs which annoying  when eating. came late dinner place pretty empty.  good place families though b c overly loud pretentious.

i special fish dish split w ahi.  both pretty good.  also started w some oysters apps tried oysters which good.  parmesan tater tots biggest hit apps.

it friend's bday brought cheesecake him.  also tiramisu which bad. love it... actually serve blue cheese olives dirrrtttty martinis!  believe add bit charge but worth throw scotch egg appetizer mini shopping snack Such good place eat! 

The service seriously fantastic burger damn good. dont remember names desserts couple months ago when but GOD where AMAZING. them own home made cinnamon ice cream... wow. Please try it.

Can't wait back next time vegas. pays your research! $99 Steak Deal 2 3 course meal which consisted your choice of Appetizer caesar salad clam chowder
Main Entree one per party 40 oz porterhouse steak delmonico steak twin lobster tails

Great deal good food nice service. Next time need remember room $1 oysters happy hour menu! Walking forum shops Caesar's Palace Christine spotted $1 oyster happy hour deal. Starving foodies popped sat oyster bar.

Ordered Parmesan Tater Tot Appetizer  holy smokes good!! Simple delicious fried semi mashed potatoes rolled heavenly crust sprinkled parmesan. left Vegas thinking tater tots.

$1 Oysters extremely fresh. + tiny tabasco bottles adorable fun. very generous oyster accompaniments well.

Burger w mushrooms came fries. impressed tasty simple burger tasted.

Sweet Corn Side  much corn lover but Christine liked them OK.

Service... oyster bar shucker man rocked! He shucked held conversation took orders served food all while shucking oyster oyster oyster.... 

I would've put 3 stars place but tater tots oyster shucker server ROCKED 4 stars =] $1 dollar oysters happy hour. PURE GENIUS!

With help fellow yelpers decided oyster fix PJ Clarkes. always very leery eating oysters Vegas obvious reasons but knew good oysters did exist town just matter finding them.

So when stumbled upon reviews place knew try out. If bad least where only buck piece. 

I can't help but analogy $1 oysters equivalent dudes getting free drink tickets strip club. You're lured fact something practically free. scope place intention spending minimum amount money because wanna most bang your buck pun intended before know you're popping bottles champagne. Which exactly sister ended doing. Lack willpower even though server wasn't even doing any selling whatsoever. sells itself  why PURE GENIUS.

Anyhow oysters excellent! sister 2 dozen each champagne course. since pretty hungry going decided order few other items Calamari served hot peppers which first time them way mighty tasty. Gone 60 seconds.

French dip sandwich TOTAL SHOW STEALER!! best ever zero expectations when ordered it. just wanted some land animal protein switch bit pleasant surprise best French dip sandwich ever! always hit miss those things gave trying find good ones. came blew mind cuz coming oysters. come back just sandwich alone.

Crab cakes meh pretty standard. enough filler ingredients help bland 
taste crab meat. also made texture lil mushy.

So final check came $180 2 chicks came intention stretching dollars some cheap HH oysters. But all good cuz left big smiles faces hair tousled bit which meant good times all. love NY institutions but didn't know anything P.J. Clarke's until saw ad Las Vegas Magazine.  Established 1884 Vegas version Forum Shops Caesars caught eye Oyster Riot Happy Hour 3 6 Sunday Thursday.  fresh shucked oysters $1 each!  6 very good.  only buy drink free including wine glass.  Tater Tots also tasty. 
The ambiance does NY vibe but wish music stuck classics standards.  only heard Sinatra song when there.  Next time wish order Cadillac Burger since recommended Nat King Cole.  hope enjoying while listening Nat King Cole tune country song. Review Happy Hour ONLY

Here worried would some sort crazy wait happy hour days time located website . wrong no wait all. seated immediately. place really good happy hour deal $1 oysters half shell! Even cab driver recommended it!

Honestly 1 dollar oysters steal! Pretty good quality even greater price it. also serve 3 types sauces cocktail horseradish something else couldn't identify which did like . 

I tried sliders. thought ok. Definitely filling price $1.50 each which probably size your fist. sliders comprised regular patty meat cheese regular bun. meh. meat bit dry.

Their ahi tacos deceiving! They're itty bitty. size your thumb. kidding. think more expensive things ordered. good. But expensive its size.

I'll definitely back more HH oysters! If oysters place great happy hour.  $1 oysters pick few different kinds.  Service great friendly.  Highly recommended!!! impressed. all. 
We started Rhode Island calamari which good. did enjoy quite bit. definitely best part meal. 
The meditteranean salad eh. description waiter much better actual salad itself. no fresh herbs piece fennel feta tangy way good feta should be.
The risotto HORRIBLE! Never ever ever this. PRE COOK risotto when comes oatmeal. better mushy oatmeal wasn't trying hater oatmeal . first risotto put horrible send back. waiter said chef upset personally making replacement. LESS 5 minutes later waiter returns it. UT OH! Risotto should NEVER come less 5 minutes. If chef personally prepared dish he needs fired. disgusting. mushy barely could eat it. HOWEVER said. flavor dish delicious. wine mushrooms yummy. But hell wants eat mushy rice....unless course ADVERTISE mushy rice. It also wouldn't $24 . 
The company made meal fantastic but wouldnt back. just another place strip targets tourists doesnt really care whether enjoyed your meal not. group bone filet pork chops salmon mac n cheese mashed potatoes well Cesar salads start. All delicious! also deal where 2 people bottle wine soup salad steaks dessert $99 which screaming deal high quality food smack dab center strip. Review Happy Hour Only!

Our waiter best described aspiring actor because word he 'on stage' trying entertain while going throught usual excercise telling favorites menu story behind restaurant prepare food etc. most part entertaining until asked regualar ice water instead bottled he launched into speech bad water Lake Mead drink its 'filled discarded anibiotics' which he said prescribed antibiotics less effective best! Huh?? lived Las Vegas over 20 years never heard never problem antibiotics being less effective. point became obvious he just trying hard upsell bottled water. insisted tap water he us.

As far food waiter talking 'amazing incredible signature appetizer' which tater tot potato cakes. Well buildup decided try few orders table. discovered exactly regular tater tots except perhaps texture them bit creamier store bought version. Strike two waiter's credibility.

I also ordered clam chowder absolute highlight evening hands down best bowl New England Style chowder ever had. 

Next ordered entrees. ordered fish chips daughter ordered steak. told waiter place know beef particular because its sourced some ranch midwest where cows roam 20 000 acres etc. 

My fish chips absolutely bland bland could be. resort drowning them malt vinegar tartar sauce them edible. 

As famous incredible steak known for...tough strange texture. Strike three.

All all experience very hit miss best probably more miss hit. clam chowder I'd rate two stars. won't going back.

Enjoy! review based happy hour. 

EVERYDAY. 3PM 6PM. $1 OYSTERS. EVERYDAY. 

Really need say more? 

I found place help fellow Yelpers planning UYEs that couldn't __ . When heard oyster prices made sure come check myself! probably happiest day Joshua B's life. killed 3 dozen first trip.. hehehe. 5 different types oysters. practically tried all them X all trip though. happy hour don't really choice which you'll getting just which they'll serve. 

We lucky enough try two different kinds first visit. First Skookum WA then Fanny Bay BC. told shucker Fanny Bay top 5 best oysters but honestly preferred Skookum. Fanny Bay just large taste still somewhat oyster noob prefer them little smaller. sliminess oyster just overwhelming. second visit consisted Fanny Bay again Crystal Point. Crystal Point definitely favorite thus far. 

If oysters don't fill they no where close me.. should try sliders! $1.50 per slider 2 all really need your dozen oysters! They're honestly made perfection. Last HH menu item tried fish tacos... don't even bother considering plate especially fellas reading . When presented infront thought joke presenting demo item really coming out. 8 little tiny fish tacos lined stretched rectangular plate looked could fit Barbie's hands. even kidding wish was. 

The tacos major bust but won't keep always returning inhaling those precious little oysters! can't those prices! 4 5 stars only because yet return try actual menu. past enjoyed establishment sent all family town way but now seen changes taken place am questioning.....The quality food down. food pink raw quit different flavor wasn't use to.  Really sad guess try Gordon Ramsay Pub haven't heard anything but G R E T things it.  certainly don't think chef Ramsay would send anything R W kitchen.  afraid ask re fire since couldn't hold phantom waitress.  only good thing easy access car leave. Excellent service. Adequate food. East coast oysters excellent. Filet undercooked chewy. Onion soup cooked long enough. Mashed potatoes luke warm bland.  many other choices category better executed food. However...as stated service great. stumbled upon another Happy Hour spot Las Vegas Strip over P.J. Clarke's which daily 3pm 6pm.  headliners $1 freshly shucked oysters $1.50 burger sliders. You'll see why put quotations sliders.

I ordered half dozen $1 oysters. 
http bit.ly WYjLmu
It really doesn't any better $1 oysters Happy Hour.  cares oyster farm came because they're $1 each!!   Nicely sized pretty good!

Now check PJ's Famous Sliders
http bit.ly XADMzK
Now know why put quotations.  Sliders?  kidding me?  sliders little burgers stuff your mouth two bites.  suckers huuuuge!!  Very tasty also complimented oysters very well.  almost steal $1.50 each.

Washed all down $3 Blue Moon which another great Happy Hour deal.  all together half dozen oysters two sliders Blue Moon came whopping $12 before tax tip.  Awesome!!!

Thanks guys definitely back bring everyone know here. Wonderful dinner nice casual atmosphere!  looking nice place take 12 year old son he didn't overly dressed place hit mark.

Located Forum Shops great location best service long time.  server very nice made great suggestions food things area.

Food spectacular! husband did 99.00 special marvelous deal steaks melted mouths. Salad best homemade dressings ever tasted.  desserts fresh tasted homemade.  son skirt steak loved it.

Add great service atmosphere must try Vegas! four came happy hour. drinks $25 two. Sliders $1.50 remember. were...mmmmm mmmm goood! thing regret getting tuna taco tartare because really tiny bites. friend mac cheese she loved it. calamari... well couldn't take hands off it. sexy...

On another note want apologize waitress because ended feeling well it because something ate earlier day combination cocktail . definitely because food. All friends ate ate did sick. sh*tty state waitress very helpful understanding. 

I felt better drank some ginger ale water ate some bread potty. took good 20 minutes better. YEAH TMI? did rush even when put head down table rest bit.

Anyways very accommodating patient. am grateful service. came Show Dinner deal. think $100 bottle wine appetizer soup salad steak lobster dessert. deal great price. Lobster good but steak decent. Can't say no $1 oyster. Minus star horrible service!!!!!!!!!!!! work Forum Shops eating off mall employee menu ever since started offer it. Although recent altercation particular menu still pleased prices offer. PJ burger pretty amazing must say previously priced $5 $6 but worth every penny. hamburger patty good size thick enough them ask want meat cooked. Most time patty cooked way asked but most recent asked medium rare gave medium well well done. alright no big deal. also chicken sandwich portion chicken put bun huge. use brioche bread which absolutely love. deals mall employee menu can't glad continue offer it. service pretty good but can't comment dinning since haven't yet. P.J.s Ok over priced quality food but standard strip guess.  wife couple friends stopped quick bite before heading town.  general food pretty good but some execution problems.  French fries where over done Caprese salad drowned vinaigrette fish chips drowned grease.  other entrees fine salmon which very well cooked two friends burger mini tacos I never seen tacos small...but he reported good The atmosphere nice close intimate.
Overall would recommend passing P.J.s never ending search BFH Burger Heaven P.J. Clarke's.
It quite good but sublime. Certainly same league Burger Bar Bradley Ogden.
Most notable single element mozzerella cheese choice wish more restaurants offered that. 

The service PJC however some best ve ever Vegas restaurant. host wait staff busboys prompt friendly efficient. know some times leave tip because think to...In case wanted to.

And way back room dining area quieter more touristy front area juke box free some best music ever Sinatra Ray Charles Nat Cole Stevie Ray Vaughn. everything better. 5 Stars Oyster Happy Hour. Best around 7 days week YUM! Looking some $1 oysters attracted P.J's wasn't disappointed.  good enjoyed being able sit oyster bar watch them being shucked put bed crushed ice.   

The Skookum Virginia oysters medium large size which good if larger size.  Interesting oysters Seattle normally smaller size Las Vegas same variety bit larger.

I definitely come back when Las Vegas again. $1 oysters. fresh delicious. Worth every penny!! Pros $1 oyster happy hour 2 45 6
Cons No drink specials during happy hour

Craving midday snack fiancee happened see sign $1 oyster happy hour 2 45 pm 6 pm.  love oysters.  love oysters $1 dollar even more.  sat oyster bar service pretty good.  ended eating 3 dozen oysters myself. Yippie.

They pretty good burger but should definitely come oyster happy hour. Only bummer wasn't any drink specials. REVIEW 365 2013!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE LA Style Crushed DeMELished!!!


Met few close friends celebrate GF's birthday. heard place seen but never opportunity until now. Let's start restaurant itself.  thought actual restaurant clean loved ambiance because wasn't packed Holiday weekend.  menu just basic pager food side wines other.  first thing catch eye PJ Clarke's menu sticker price.  your choices different steaks lobster fish burgers few different appetizers.  prices bit high but expected since strip Forum.  chophouse steak seafood entrees expect pay strip.  portions looked just right too.  gripe prices other food outisde steaks.  Everything outside steaks bit over priced.  wasn't mood steak visit ended Cadillac Burger Over $20 .  No frills above average taste but worth price tag opinion.  tater tots calamari onion strings appetizers felt all three little salty side.  Terri R Lobster Mac thought pretty good but touch salty side too.  

Service wasn't best. where hear chef yelling staff server wasn't most attentive.  First he took forever take order.  When orders finally came he just dropped off food without even asking if needed anything else.  Yes sir ketchup would nice fries. Please some dipping sauce onion strings would great.  knife would perfect meal but guess butter knife all get.  also allergic reaction dessert my fault .  All needed hinder nauseousness some crackers.  server busy chatting buds wave another server take care us.  sad part...our group big tip automatically added.  means server close $100 doing almost nothing. Overall biggest fan PJ's.

All lost though.  still great time friends birthday girl Terri R.  Happy Birthday GP!!!  If could rate restaurant based great time all during dinner would 5+ Stars sure.  

PS Read reviews...seems Happy Hour way here.  Maybe back.  But now 3 stars all PJ Clarke. Pretty nice happy hour cant $1 oysters $1.50 sliders! came Friday during happy hour sat oyster bar only 1 other couple plenty room. Ordered dozen oysters couple Bloody Mary's. Bloody Mary excellent prefect amount sweet spice. careful though each $15 suppose need money somewhere since pretty much giving away oysters. oysters BC cant remember name okay. best but nowhere near worst oysters had. 
Overall place solid 3 star place while $1 oysters drew into place tab quickly $100 few drinks couple $1.50 sliders price could better oysters elsewhere. Still would no problems coming back would actually try $99 dinner 2 special here. never heard place until saw Restaurant Week line up.  parmesan tater tots which tater tots used school is good bad?  decide .  smooth mashed potatoes inside crunchy outside.  salmon nicely cooked but didn't care sauce.  kalamata olives overpowered everything else.  cheesecake good.  companion steak frites which huge.  steak perfectly cooked tasty.  fries nothing special but terrible either.  

The service bit strange.  ask Restaurant Week menu which earned eye roll.  imagine servers don't menu due price point but irritating see them express this.  Beyond service sometimes great glasses being refilled promptly etc.  halfway through meal think forgotten service level fell off considerably.  

I liked atmosphere general would come back try again.  time give eye roll free pass but next time let know rude is. Best place fresh raw oysters Las Vegas $1 per oyster during happy hour 2 45 6 pm .  burger perfection.  Order medium rare pint Guinness. $1 oysters 2 45 PM 6 PM everyday! 

After making huge list happy hours Las Vegas boyfriend picked few made list.  glad did wish didn't order sliders tater tots because would given place 5 stars.  oysters fresh one thing bothered tiny shells oysters constantly pick mouth w fingers...bleh gross lol cocktail sauce horseradish cured oyster fix.  beers $3 warning tiny mug...so sure if you're really getting your money worth but hey well oysters .  service also great sat oyster bar chatted employees friendly D

The sliders tater tots...ugh wasn't great...I would rather ordered another dozen oysters...all did fill appetizing way. 

Stick oysters beer...trust me. Amazing food. Spicy calamari tomato soup spectacular. Nice watch people walking by. Terrific service. Great food.  Nice ambiance.  Helpful super dooper awesome staff.

Expensive!  hate feeling ripped off. boyfriend family came dinner Wednesday night reservations 6 30pm. quite empty...maybe because happy hour just over??  restaurant very dim definitely great place take someone date!  party 5 since some meat eaters wine fans opted prefix meal which 3 course meal bottle wine two people $99.  Since 5 2 prefix meals another entree.  ordered

Appetizer Field Greens Salad Balsamic Vinaigrette very refreshing but little heavy vinaigrette.  ask side Classic New England Clam Chowder probably best clam chowders ever!  definitely skimp clams!  Very rich creamy chunky.  Delicious oyster crackers!

Entree Colossal Sliced Prime Aged Porterhouse Steak 40oz am big steak fan but some steaks really tasty.  steak little dry although still cooked medium rare cut meat dry. Broiled Aged Delmonico Steak 18oz paired Jumbo Lump Maryland Crab Cakes Wow delmonico steak could tasted better!  juicy moist some fatty parts which like .  Perfect balanced Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes! 

Dessert Warm Granny Smith Apple Cobbler good but nothing memorable NY Style Cheesecake Warm Berry Compote love cheesecake bonus me!  berry compote adds different taste normal cheesecake.  cheesecake itself creamy crust soft.

Sides Grilled Jumbo Asparagus $9.15 nothing special.  just plain old asparagus.  could myself any other sides besides this....ridiculous price veggies Crispy Onion Strings YUM!!  love anything fried anything thin!!  super delicious perfectly seasoned!  

Since ordered 2 prefix meals just opened bottle wine let take other home.  staff seems very professional well put together.  server dropped dishes right plates clattered first thing notice everyone gets scene cleans while others asking if okay if hurt just showing concerns if anything could us.  STRONG EFFORT showing customer service guys!  I'd come back try some other items well.  Maybe happy hour $1 oysters??

NOTE Clean bathrooms Happy Hour 3 6pm husband decided wanted date night middle longest weeks work together P.J. Clarke's choice.

I made reservation 5 00 but when hostess able locate it. Grrr... Luckily wasn't busy seated oyster bar right away. But still bothered made reservations didn't show anywhere if busy night would've turned differently.

We sat down oyster bar gentlemen behind bar dressed old style uniforms complete paperboy hats. classy era heart much! interior looked old New York Chicago bar restaurant. Tons b w photos plastered walls even restrooms! Looks wise excited could wait try food!

They shuck oysters fresh right front you. ordered two dozen being Happy Hour only $1 each! D I forgot call them oysters British Columbia UBER salty more used but satisfied craving nonetheless. 

The hubs shared bone in ribeye creamed spinach. way steak seasoned clarified butter oOoOoOoOo man just melted your mouth! usually fan seasoned steak other salt pepper MAYBE garlic powder but whatever seasonings used combined right amount made want come back more!

Yep fan Nice bistro menu.  Loud pub sports bar atmosphere but certainly tolerable.

Had prime steak best cut meat months!  Well prepared well served.  Sides good well.

Great meal just sure don't thinking price range same Applebees. Visited gastropub sat night. service great ordered definitely enjoyed every bite it! Onto food review *Crisp Monterey Calamari Rhode Island Style * has spicy kick garlic jalepenos!  YUM!

*Cripsy Duck Salad* the pomegranate seeds vinaigrette complements well w duck. the duck portion big DELISH!

*Steamed Penn Cove Mussels Fries* a whole pot mussels cherry tomoatoes YUM!

*Bubble Sqeak* it good but nothng special tasted big ol tater tot hasbrown cake. Great Happy Hour specials 3 6pm DAILY.  $1 oysters $1.50 sliders.  Found new oyster spot.  things huge. Highly recommend happy hour!!!  sat bar enjoyed $1 oysters $1.50 sliders $3 domestic draft beers.  Everything delicious bartender provided great service.  Would definitely come back happy hour again maybe try $99 special 2 person steak dinner. Sat bar blast.  Food great Smitty MG awesome.  Strip Steak Fries grabbed some peppers put too.  Very good.

Highly recommend! easy. Five star hands down. just best meals Vegas. Ahi ask nearly raw bed wasabi mashed potatoes drizzle some amazing unctuous glaze made want lick plate topped most spicy pea shoots nice spicy counterpoint variety flavors textures underneath. Absolutely incredible. Wouldn't change thing need return soon repeat. Service fantastic. hear lobster mac'n'cheese die for. looked very rich something may want share huge. Don't miss angel fluff tater tots. They're nothing you've ever had. hello tomato jam? Oh yeah.

I love giving 5 stars when its embarrassingly amazing. P.J. Clarke's opened tonight Forum Shops Caesar's.  regular Friday Night gang met last night last soft openings. interest full disclosure dinner comped mostly limited evening's featured softie burgers.  say mostly because when late victims traffic engulfed Strip due influx CES tourists friends already gorging plate raw oysters wasn't list given.   coming Convention center took 45 minutes Caesar's then another 10 car valet'd since full.

Hubster don't eat oysters friends managed convince them bring shrimp.  gawd those biggest damned shrimp ever seen.  terrific.

The real freebie consisted wine beer burgers fries salad.  We're white wine drinkers no Riesling just Chardonnay Pino Grigio.  Pino super dry some Merlot.  salad big disappointment just pile ugly greens few thin slices tiniest baby radish ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't anything else even crouton.

The burgers great fresh meaty oversalted but buns just ordinary.  ordered mine Vermont cheddar sauteed onions mushrooms.  Toppings $1.20 each brought burger close $14 which guess par Strip which why stick mostly local.  also ordered cup coffee cold.

What really drowned place though water pun intended.  waiter asked whether all wanted water.  said no but anyway.  served small glasses slightly larger juice glasses no logo.  no brand approve no cork sniff no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when pretend bill noticed CHARGED WATER!!!  hell thinking???  Lake Mead become designer label??  dear reader death knell restaurant.

The service spotty.  place wasn't more one third full yet waiter some trouble keeping getting things right.  Service picked tremendously when Marty said he busser joined team.  young earnest full time Type he over above see satisfied.  He definitely worth price admission.

P.J. Clarke's venerable New York institution business since 1884  no typo.  They're suddenly pushing national branch Chicago just opened D.C. now Vegas.  tried check website see full menu but links Vegas page aren't working least Firefox Chrome. I don't near IE .  IMHO symbolic lengths they'll need travel distinguish themselves all competition town.  if persist charging tap water going long road travel. remember seeing happy hour $1 oyster special last time Vegas walking through Caesars Palace mall.  told wife should check joint mid day snack.

We ordered dozen oysters snack while people watched.  Came 3 sauces.... cocktial mignonette horseradish.  oysters look small but actually surprisingly plump.  Clean sweet briny.  good ordered another 1 2 dozen.  Also some onion strings which well seasoned also very good.

Can't price happy hour.  Made want back eat real meal there.  Stay tuned.... Good food service.  Food expensive.  stayed seafood catagory.  Claims best burger strip don't know didn't try it.  am sure back due expensive small portions.  many good places Las Vegas Joe's Steak Seafood which few steps away. twice during trip once lunch then next night just drinks . amazing when walking closing but did matter. Las Vegas friend's 40th birthday Awesome come ! drinks very good. fan Old fashion very different seltzer water.....I know know then its Old Fashion but hey its it. great selection bar even them cleaning packing night awesome! Happy Hour = $1 oysters!  Yeah probably many but birthday.  watched others came late upset couldn't cheap oysters fine establishment.  C'mon people seafood high quality steal $1 piece!  time casino buffet. empty dinner. ask $99 porterhouse special 2. Appetizer steak desert very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Ordered 1 extra side weren't just eating protein dinner.  Finished 3 4 wine bottle myself. Thank god came meal. Service little lacking.. If compare would brands porterhouse 2. evening Cher along 400 other people Jeff looking bite eat.  walked through Forum shops stumbled upon PJ Clarke's.  Given didn't music blasting crazy looking clientele line walked menu board check out.  saw made walk in.

Our server s made stay.

Pretty much every person working tonight stopped check us.  Most them eager share favorites share story offer something else.  first thought going annoyed but later appreciated genuine honesty desire serve staff.  

We split crab cake.  word delicious.  price however better be!  crab cakes mostly crab only slight crust top.  

Jeff ordered fresh clams oysters.  He said fresh good. I slightly grossed watching eat them. Jeff burger.  He inhaled assume good.  Rather fries he asked sauteed spinach.  fresh tasting perfectly cooked.  

I originally going order fish chips but run out.  waitress Lisa suggested trout.  
Oh goodness.  unlike any fish ever tried.  pan fried cast iron skillet.  top sliced potatoes bacon capers mushrooms.  know sounds strange but absolutely delicious.  asked few pretzel rolls.  came bit dijon butter.  All together even better.  almost licked plate.  
It would perfect meal found piece plastic wrap under fish.  No big deal.  already finished but did want let waitress know kitchen more careful.  
Lisa took fish off bill.  Super class!  

I return next time am town. Party five all sat oyster bar happy hour.  first time try oysters pretty good.  However Hispanic guy wearing cabbie hat working oyster bar didn't experience good even great.  Drinks came slow he forgot condiments and other info oysters just plain old super rigid guy.  even asked if could try other stuff bar he gave quick NO continued happy hour.  never saw crack smile joke around except other coworkers.  just bad experience.  told another person works oyster bar hundred times better next time sure its frowny face mcgee working oyster bar. Really great food all around nice relaxed Americana atmosphere lets forget crazy mall hubbub just outside door.  personally love fear cooked perfectly medium done burger.  place voted best burger Las Vegas reason folks.  simple delicious want eat.  Also great bleu cheese wedge salad some really amazing lobster mac cheese.  Great service combined reasonable for Las Vegas prices round place convenient delightful lunch dinner. OK first time life simply could wait YELP let place because START FINISH most unbelievabe unmitigated dinner disaster last 10 years.

6 saddle bar order some drinks.  NOBODY but  2 people bar bartender more interested carrying conversation two other guys then serving making drinks.  am kidding when say he could care less ordering he babbling two patrons checking phone texts etc short SHOULD LEFT THEN.

After finally gettting drinks sit presented specials etc.. order very high end bottle cabernet which takes forever arrive NO RED WINE GLASSES available kdding.  Appears  small wedding private dining room monopolizeing all staff.

No Deserts coffee wanted tried. 

So review.

Appetizers Oysters shirmp very good fresh.

I came two nights row happy hour oyster deals. Super fresh delish best all... dirt cheap! first night sat oyster bar which highly recommend only because put your order ahead everyone else's! 15 orders ahead that's busy get! able oysters within 2 minutes. second night decided sit bar where served alcohol watch football game big screen. oysters took 15 minutes each order! didn't problem wait all since hubby just chilling drinking night.

The oysters medium sized shucked once your order in. comes few side sauces top your oysters well. ordered crab cakes which happy hour menu tasted okay. wasn't meaty expected be. probably wouldn't recommend anyone order this! 

If you're ever Las Vegas highly recommend come oysters! happened last day going Vegas dawned upon eaten steak yet Sure prime rib buffets even some ribs but leave Vegas without steak stomach gasp could allowed.  While doing some last minute window shopping signed onto Yelp found place thank goodness Yelp.  lunch time assume menu given during lunch your choice 2 steaks.

But there's item 1 2 price high end steaks.  Steak Frites delicious.  very tender flavorful although depends sauce choose case chose classic sauce .  skirt steak I think thin steak.  But good.

The $15 classic burger tiny ... just because already cut half us.  tasty but didn't think worth $15.   okay though everything Vegas seems more expensive.  

They sweet potato fries.  feel things shouldn't run Vegas. ordered shoestring fries instead ... don't know your shoestrings but shoestrings aren't size telephone cables.  

Most wouldn't warrant 2 star review since service fine.  BUT when Fred gets 4 bug bites leg 2 bug bites all sitting lunch time go.  don't know if fleas ... but ankles itched swelled needed hightail there.  

Who knows maybe and hopefully them unique incident but we're going come back test again. Great place right next more hyped seafood place Forum Shops.

Total incl gratuity $60

Pretty cool place HH.  spent morning early afternoon wandering forum shoppes built appetite HH.  Afterall pass $1.00 oysters?  expected place really quiet Tuesday afternoon 3pm.  seated oyster bar ordered two dozen fresh shucked oysters.  mignonette oysters served tart tasty!  couldn't enough.  oysters big yet flavorful.

The french onion soup salty but good.  really impressed.  broth very strong best had.  only complaint aftermath.  dying thirst afterwards.  sat down tables gamble downed four bottles water.  only nibble french dip sandwich.  Soggy bread isn't really thing definitely wasn't choice entree.

The servers oyster bar worked very quickly efficiently very friendly.  Service definitely above par.  Total bill $60.00 little steep considering happy hour too.  Might return some french onion soup. am NY resident well Vegas native home holidays.  decided lunch Forum family excited see PJ Clarke's... sadly reputation knowing good restaurant now question.  swore family great NY institution... must try it!

FOOD burgers all good though medium more well done taters great but ketchup sweet fried onion strings great mac n cheese side not lobster good but smaller portion thought calamari good most disappointing bacon burger... asked extra crispy manager said he would bring extra crispy.. came back chopped greasy bacon soggy THE SERVICE hostess nice friendly overall v good waitress basically non existent and restaurant busy.. lots open tables around us ...they served wrong drinks kids sister bar herself kids drinks because waitress basically disappeared waited v long time before even drinks then put order..

overall ...v sad say visiting PJ Clarke's warn all NY friends visiting Vegas craving burgers nothing PJ Clarke's 3rd Ave ... falls very short!!! hotel room wasn't ready GF decided check P.J. Clarke's lunch.   Since dinner reservations later evening looking reasonably light meal.  perusing P.J. Clarke's menu opted split Torn Basil Chicken Sandwich $14.95 order Lobster Mac Cheese $24.50 between us.  server smartly took initiative kitchen split sandwich plate each half separately.  shredded chicken breast moist tender resting thick slices mozzarella cheese tomato topped flavorful basil pesto.  Unfortunately server misheard lobster mac cheese order received side regular mac cheese instead.  When noted mistake she immediately corrected order received freshly made dish lobster mac cheese.  P.J. Clarke's doesn't use elbow macaroni its lobster mac cheese electing use appeared orecchiette instead.  dish worth wait!  best lobster mac cheese pleasure eating its nice cheesiness ample amount nicely done claw meat.  bit pricey but outrageous all things considered.  P.J. Clarke's provided enjoyable experience capped off solid service.  worth time dime. Avoid!! gastrointestinal system deeply regret those tasteless $1 oysters Also friend ordered French 75 bartender no clue instead admitting much looked book ended simply pouring champagne gin into red wine glass which really wanted to pay for . Also when asked check wrong person's bill. Sigh. Buck shuck oysters 3 6pm Cesar's Palace steal! only wish wider variety oyster available happy hour. Came Vegas Pacific Northwest buck shuck oysters Pacific Northwest. 

Their happy hour menu more oysters well.


Good way snack nice cocktail. Stopped randomly when Caesar's Palace forum shops alternative Spago upscale dinner.  Dacor nice patio stretches into form shops people watching available.

I started Crisp Parmesan Tater Tots which supposedly 200 year old recipe home made tots.  Very good flavor crunch.  Tomato 'jam' basically home made catchup but very nice.  Portion size little small considering likely inexpensive make. $9.90 7 10.

I also bowl french onion gratinee soup.  nicely prepared smooth rich broth customary crostini topped torched gruierre cheese.  Classic. $7.40 8 10.

For main course Crab Cakes which JUMBO LUMP Maryland blue crab served fries.  fries came slightly green swapped them side mashed potatoes which excellent.  crab cakes KILLER good almost ZERO filler 100% jumbo lump Maryland Blue.  Size excellent coaster sized very thick.  Crab flavor abound. lucked because made extra free since waiter didn't chef accidentally broke mine when flipping it.  Extra points waiter let eat slightly damaged well new one.  excellent crab cake just good ones served Mr. Stoxx which love but larger. $34.10 9.5 10.  perfect score because crumbs top not throughout thought little thick but realize keep them together pan. came Dana's Happy Hour UYE. Happy Hour normally served raw bar alcohol bar 3 6 daily. main draw $1 fresh shucked oysters but other treats well. other bites happy hour menu which see online site all various prices $6 9 2 1 cocktail day $3 draft beer $6 prosecco. 

While knew signs bar able sit table. BF chose Lagunitas IPA Tenaya Creek Hefeweizen drink since included $3 choices which nice only drink craft beers. 

We started off dozen oysters which Crystal Pointe delicious. Lovely fresh creamy. another 8 those ones different breed cannot remember name but double size bit more briny. know Ca one. Also very fresh good but preferred first kind. give migionette cocktail horseradish. pick oyster HH but depending availability guess changes. 

We also cod bites which really delicious. 3 small fish filets but very fresh fried crisp solid sauce. Also slider each which good but standard. decent deal $1.50 each though would some fill if you're making meal happy hour. 

Service pretty good. waiter all worried since he found Yelpers he new guy just started but he good attentive nothing worry there. he didn't know he find us.

While happy hour good deal considering quality racked fast! top notch oysters shortlist. Yelp 100 Challenge 47 100 Didn't time try restaurant time.   talked maitre d' phone trying reservation he learned mainly interested sampling oysters he recommended come happy hrs 2 6 30 dollar oyster.  appreciated candor  5 star service right there.  wish come them instead Joe's Seafood Steak.

Over priced steak. Ruths chris would cheaper. west side oysters. surf n turf. Yummy. lobster served outside shell. tater tots worth it. Asparagus decent. Mac cheese came shells no cheese. Onion strings perfect. Others ribeye loved it. $1 oyster 2 45 6pm!!! 2 11pm!! But once 2 45pm comes around ready some oysters!!!!

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

Came Monday during happy hour $1 oysters Laguna bay oysters California.  Amazing love Las Vegas!  Two dozen puppies pint world's greatest IPA Lagunitas legendary Sonoma County pint Sin City's own Tenaya Creek brown ale under $30.  

Bartender kept entertained very helpful....tough job he has.

Needless say tip very generous $1 OYSTERS during happy hour.

and  all need know. PJ Clarkes experience more reason.  friends joined Las Vegas food critic John Curtis.  PJ's fav places he wanted give full experience.  sampled all best dishes very best service.  enjoyed meal wine braised short ribs signature burger superb.  strip steak alright am Iowa gal somewhat picky when comes steak.  favorite thing french onion soup very best ever had. . . order french onion soup everywhere doesn't compare PJ's.  dessert several options try loved bread pudding normally bread pudding.  LOVE PJ's bread pudding!  dessert actually haunts dreams.  would return just soup dessert. . . maybe burger coming midwestern girl  saying something. forever since back PJ Clarke's. first time very impressive. time exact opposite. Two came happy hour afternoon shopping Forums. far best happy hours Strip. little early because seats fill fast front oyster bar. special runs 3pm everyday easy camp there.

First all nothing beats $1 oysters. All other food items good but $1 OYSTERS! changes every day. day Fanny Bay. Paired spoonful mignonette squeeze lemon made perfection. Once past amazing offer mac'n'cheese best. jammed pack bacon peas. 

As drink offers check list specialty cocktail day. just stuck Old Fashion. best companion seafood but cut decadence mac well. 

On way saw advertisement date special. three course meal two select bottle wine less $100. Hello?! still Strip? must come back day. received wrong order but still good meal.  Could epic fail but worked okay.

I ordered chopped sirloin received skirt steak instead. worked since really liked skirt steak but big mistake since totally different cut $10 more per person.  well seasoned tough order sauce little spice can't remember name side perfect steak. Along skirt steak french onion soup which great sherry taste lots onion. would definitely recommend your meal. 

If don't want fine dining tired gorging buffets place varied menu worth checking if Caesars Palace area. wouldn't special trip however thought somewhat overpriced. service trip disappointing.  Las Vegas work.  made reservation 10 restaurant 6 45 Wednesday night not peak time .  Two people group showed 10 15 min early drink hostess showed them where we'd sitting.  showed gave table another group explanation someone party named Chris also .  didn't complain took 25 30 min reservation time before sat another table but surprised wasn't apology.  3 hours left restaurant received notice OpenTable restaurant cancelled reservation.  called since wasn't happy couldn't give 100 Open Table points reservation 10 people.  manager promised fix it never did.  

The food alright but somewhere better service. Oysters great!  healthy grilled chicken breast salad.  people watch shoppers while  eat.  definitely going back! didn't order anything myself since wasn't hungry but tried few things... Dollar oysters Virginia think calamari. 

The oysters VERY excellent!!!! Omg calamari! wasn't rubbery all such smooth buttery garlicky italian seasony flavor. best calamari ever had. only wish place more affordable wallet. checking cocktail shrimp and... $18. 5 large shrimps! What?!

Our server wonderful though. celebrating 21st birthday even though he drinking all day... She wasn't bothered made more entertaining him. Came $99 x 2 party four

Chowder good but remarkable
Salad awful drenched vinegar
18oz Ribeye tasty but lots gristle fat nice texture
40oz Porterhouse outside cuts tasty but mostly bland
Apple crumble good
Cheesecake awful defrosted
Atmosphere poor more sports bar steakhouse
Service just OK chose restaurant based Yelp reviews usual people right. Wait staff awesome giant shrimp cocktail delicious cocktail sauce came best ever had. Amazing ahi tuna main course along several delicious chocolate martinis. know those flavors probably don't compliment each other but theyre favorite. fish served wasabi mashed potatos which everyone tasted loved all managed steal bites everyone elses food. No room desert outside those chocolate martinis. Weill group going order another round oysters desert but he decided he just couldn't squeeze them in. wife see Steelers Jets AFC championship game. PJ Clarke's NYC few times wanted see was. 

The location 1st floor newer Forum Shops area kinda weird but set pretty nice. can't believe Villa Reale same spot year ago. 

It pretty easy find 2 stools bar. Beer prices standard strip. can't justify paying $7 pint Miller Lite opted $10 bottles Duvel. You're pretty buzzed 3 those babies. 

The bar interesting widescreen TV built into wall. Its set 8 screens combine into separate 2 4 8 things showing. looks mirror when TV off which kinda cool. lines between screens still annoyed when watching game full screen though. bartender told bar able obtain pre CES its only place one. He also said cost more 6 figures purchase install which kinda crazy. 

We also order fried calamari Rhode Island style which lot hot peppers tasted great. also only place ever ordered calamari where no tentacles served. dig tentacles!! 

Raw bar looked awesome but its hard compete Joe's right across way. bartender also said haven't done any marketing place yet. What's taking long? Stopped midst epic casino crawl 'Mad Men Special' Iceberg wedges Manhattans. Amazing oyster bar extremely cheerful attentive staff definitely recommended. Great staff food match.  Cocktails superb.  folks now run restaurant sure everyone good time. People just learning place Vegas now before everyone finds it.  everyone's favorite place soon! Pj Clarke's decorated similarly neighbor Joe's Stone Crab.  Lots pictures hung long gone celebrites brass wood leather but red checked tablecloths.  room really cool.  Check details ceiling light fixtures.  Totally cool.

Service outstranding.  barely anyone there.  food great most part.  light all.  Menu reads American East Coast Bistro even looks physically bistro menu.  read people erroneously referring PJ Clarkes gastropub but case.  Wishful thinking local forgotten foodwriters' parts Vegas first real gastro.  place lot more Mon Ami Gabi Longman Eagle.

Regarding food bacon dates best outside Firefly.  clam oyster pot rich hell but tasty.  famous burger didn't much me.  Reminded greasy 2 inch thick burgers cheap bun mom used stovetop way back when.  bun soaks grease sticks patty forming doughy shell around meat. 2 24 12 getting turned away Steakhouse Bill's Gamblin' Hall.  hungry just wanted some decent food relaxed atmosphere.   exactly got!  seated immediately server attentive without being overbearing.  Fish Chips...  delicious!  came twist usual tartar sauce looked kind chipotle mayo.  tangy mildly spicy.  would liked crispier french fries but meal good enough still giving place 4 stars.  wine list great pinot noir ordered delicious.  wish Caesar's Palace hadn't made walk 17 miles find place but definitely worth it! dined P.J.'s last weekend.  heard many great things food service check out.  atmosphere restaurant little pseudo patio well.  nice sitting people watching all crazy people come through Forum Shops.  server very friendly but did seem little awkward didn't lot eye contact.  recommendations spot enjoyed all food.  over heard other servers asking tables where little overboard.  EVERY person came table asked question.  poor table next must've answered 15 times.  little tip if hostess asks she should then communicate server. when server approaches table he she say hey heard visiting ____ welcome! Much more personal.

Anyhow food!!

We started sharing french onion soup caesar salad tater tots.  All delicious.  croutons homemade salad very flavorful.  soup served litte crock very cheesy.  tater tots favorite town but still good.  homemade served tomato jelly instead ketchup.

Main Course delmonico ribeye oscar style.  steak done perfectly crab meat bernaise amazing.  could barely eat 1 2 meat!  guest lobster mac n' cheese which very different but very delicious.  plenty lobster meat large portion.  spinach mushrooms other things mixed which different.

We side asparagus which amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  also canon potato side upon recommenation server.  am glad tried this.  actually English food called bubble squeak. Mashed potatoes sauteed bacon chopped cabbage then topped cheese sauce.  Sounds strange but great combination!  would back dish alone.

For dessert shared fresh apple cobbler topped cinammon ice cream.  warm delicious apple pie fresh oven.

Overall love place.  raw bar often happy hour specials $1 oysters.  casual but also fussy.  Everyone very friendly welcoming food great! family celebrated sister's wedding reception here. really accommodating. Roughly 25 seated back floor section restaurant. would've given them higher rating if found way organize all into large party rather two separate tables. Despite organization accommodated addressed bajillion orders well. could tell first time catering large group took orders individually. competition  between would drinks appetizer plate dinner first. could easily resolved if advised people taking specific orders first dinner orders next. Buuuuuut didn't. HUGE plus saved them check management. split checks exactly accordingly. no problems that. 4 stars you. 

I don't much say food. appetizers decent. order fries terrible tater tots. version fried mashed potato balls. mooshy overpowered garlic. YUCK! crunch fries made it. PHEW! 

Next ordered Porterhouse steak Market Fish which Halibut. Porterhouse delicious tender!! turned into NOMNIVORE. wasn't pretty. can't say same halibut. some great halibut before but really dry bland. Although soup base added flavor pretty much made taste entire dish. SAVE YOUR MONEY PORTERHOUSE. seafood isn't good. chat chef bit but he only side table all white people. Hello half people don't see. 2 stars you. 

Overall deserve 3 stars. best aspect PJ's service. very accommodating friendly. also isn't crowded which plus! restaurant best large parties wanting some alone time. waiter really nice helpful  oysters good. Happy hour oysters good deal! husband decided try rest. becasue oysters half shell while oysters great Bartender happy hour horrible.  only did take 20 minutes first cocktail we sitting bar but when disputed bill he actually started yelling front all other customers.  He actually charging more expensive premium coctail didn't order but he insisted better ordered.  finally just paid left never return. Just came dinner meeting restaurant. Chophouse Iceberg Wedge salad blue cheese dressing. Then main course Ahi Tuna Steak w wasabi potatoes citrus soy dressing veggies. dessert fresh berries warm vanilla custard.

The salad cold crisp very good. Tuna steak perfectly seared perfection. Dessert very good but warm. 

Overall fast prompt service clean organized. would recommend Tuna Steak sure. dinner meeting presentation wouldn't particular room again. speaker hard time competing Kitchen Chef yelling food orders other side wall. *Happy Hour Review Only*

As if Vegas visitors weren't SEXED enough comes $1 oysters your aphrodisiacstic pleasure so good deserves new word ! Every day happy hour 2 45 6pm features different oyster rotation. few times every bite always deliciously fresh. comes creamy horseradish vinegar shallot cocktail sauces your choosing.

PJ Clarke's also offers $3 beers 2 1 drink specials cocktail day but neither good deal oysters. beer comes mug size your hand.

Bottom line. When you're done shopping take seat bar oyster regular order dozen happy hour oysters. Then turn around say hi because likely camped there. Added MUST VISIT Vegas trips! 4 stars $1 oysters during happy hour. forget kind oysters but light refreshing. say tasted ocean. little squirt lemon vinegar shallot sauce all needed. 

I'll cut them some slack long wait oysters since seems everyone else waiting them too. barely 3pm when happy hour starts. two people furiously shucking away oysters keep demand. know where next time craving oysters around Strip. latest visit began inauspiciously noticed little gunk appetizer plate.  although didn't strike until saw neighboring diners enjoying basket bread butter never offered any.  retrospect party four probably no room another starch anyway.  But believe should offered opportunity decide ourselves.  Service otherwise good except ask Sweet Low Iced Tea twice.

We began two appetizers excellent hot Parmesan Tater Tots dozen superb tasting East Coast Oysters Half Shell.  made blunder mistaking horseradish garlic delicious cold oysters became quite hot very quickly mouth but still enjoyed downing several light oysters prelude hearty meal follow.

This time Onion Soup Gratinee wasn't perfect because cheesy top sunk bit side crock.  But rich beefy broth well caramelized onions nearly so.  Iceberg Lettuce Wedge tasty bacon tomatoes Bleu Cheese Dressing very good refreshing.

My Surf Turf consisted 8 oz. Filet Mignon accompanied Red Wine Sauce paired Maine Lobster Tail lightly breaded likely Old Bay Seasoning.  lobster good Drawn Butter but almost overcooked.  Filet prepared medium rare ordered nicely seasoned enhanced Wine Sauce very good both texture taste.  three dining companions all enjoyed entrees well.  Shared Shoestring Potatoes Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes generous side Sauteed Mushrooms just added fine repast.

For dessert going split Chocolate Creme Brulee among but soon thought better privately sought server tell charge TWO Chocolate Creme Brulees dining mates share.  meal's end enjoying best Chocolate Creme Brulee ever experienced while rest table struggled finish another certainly no regrets hogging myself.  Creamy smooth cool magnificent close fine 2 1 2 hour dinner.        
    
4 1 2 stars overall! practically dragged non seafood lover girlfriend perfectly coiffed hair into P.J.'s could indulge $1 fresh oyster happy hour. She happy when she saw sliders champagne happy hour menu practically doing backflips when giant tray 10 oysters half shell complete trio sauces champagne mignonette housemade cocktail sauce housemade VERY STRONG horseradish . slurped them matter minutes even begged seafood hatin' friend try and delight she loved it! $1 fresh oysters $6 glasses bubbly P.J.'s pitstop every time LV. 

The waiters super nice. group 6 dinner wasn't very full.  Its Forum Shops its kinda far walk but its worth it.  food good service well.  all cocktails apps dinners came $500.  seafood sampler very good two table definitely ordered well ourselves!  steak very good well. wow!!
What wonderful experience !
Love management best biz!

Doug Tiare meh. while Justin B. enjoyed $1 oysters happy hour i think daily 2 45 6pm really werent any options non oyster eater myself. entire happy hour PJ Clarke's consists only $1 oysters haha. 

from reading previous reviews even searching online least looking forward happy hour 2 1 drinks but sadly informed oyster shucker Danny stopped drink promotion he kindly let 1 round 2 1 since mentioned it...but bummer couldnt more drink happy hour haha. 

Justin B. seemed enjoy 3 dozen oysters bar ended ordering Cadillac Burger since noticed sign front restaurant dubbed 'best burger vegas' actually pretty good did enjoy but probably wouldnt far saying its best there...

overall enjoyed experience b c Danny such helpful attentive server but sure wish PJ Clarke's expand its happy hour menu selection. Danny assures something works maybe next time im town curious enough check out... Absolutely best beef all over.
I love when New York then luck sustains Las Vegas.
