 Surprisingly good!!  Really good steakhouse!!!  first course shared tomato burrata cheese salad very tasty delicious.  dinner ordered prime rib Joey's Filet crab stuffed shrimp.  All very good shrimp fine but good steaks.  great deal sides 3 sides price 2.  ordered mac n' cheese we added lobster only $10 mashed potatoes asparagus.  All done very nicely.  dessert creme brulee turtle lava cake.  Both very good.  Very good place cool atmosphere.  Would definitely come back try NY strip. If want best service you'll ever experience stop ask Bobby. He compliment amazing tasting meal world class service. He probably friendliest classiest server wife ever had. also helps also offer better NY strip any other steakhouses town including Gordon Ramsey's. Hands down must visit every time come Vegas. stay strip every time but trip Fremont just eat  good is. Already looking forward next trip ask Bobby every time we're there. dubious would turn well did but fact Oscar's Steakhouse both fun place offers really good food. location Plaza Hotel Casino revitalized downtown area. outside large glass walled dining room looks though might old style Vegas its worst but inside actually quite nice. twice. first time service excellent second time very good. food whimsically described menu but well prepared. short thought might just novelty place instead found somewhere which enjoy returning. quite experience.  food wonderful best skirt steak ever service wonderful?  Saturday night extremely busy  even reservations wait. view cannot form any seat restaurant.  pricing fair portions grand.  first time dined Oscars both Oscar Carolyn Goodman but last night.  local Las Vegas really old Vegas feel Plaza great restaurant enjoy. dinner last night prior show Smith's Center really treat. stopped bar prior 5 30 reservations enjoyed some delicious strong drinks happy hour prices try Sazeriac great . waiter Frank really wonderful attended every detail including getting black napkin vs. regular white friend black pants Frank said he didn't want any possibility lint getting pants  classy . Frank very conscientious show time kept dinner moving nice but rushed pace. ordered lobster bisque which wonderful even without large pieces lobster it. rest table Caesar's salad wedge salad both reported them good great. blackened salmon spectacular well cooked perfectly seasoned. boyfriend small prime rib which amazing friends small filet which cooked perfectly spice rubbed flank steak which stuffed garlic massive. all shared asparagus nicely cooked potato wedges great only wish more sweet potatoes corn brulee which best sides sure. Frank recommended cheesecake dessert did disappoint it flown NY . left exactly 7pm which perfect show perfect time.  place back sure. hubby celebrated birthday here.  fun experience food good. crab cakes two petite filets mashed potatoes four cocktails spent $150. great experience price. Service friendly efficient Bobby old school in Goodman way made laugh. Ambiance nice. Although Plaza... Can't change that. 

We both ordered 8 ounce filets medium rare both cuts different came medium thin while other perfect. Luckily awesome husband traded gave perfect cut. He also traded steak knives the knives give ladies little wimpy!! They gave cheesecake house yummy! 

Overall great birthday didn't break bank. fantastic meal here. started bar cocktails moved dinner. crab cakes delicious possibly best ever had. main course filet mignon which perfectly cooked. side mashed potatoes which lumps lobster. Dessert amazing tiramisu.

Service great very friendly never felt rushed. I'd recommend if you're looking somewhere nice while you're downtown. Hours today 4 10. now almost 6pm still answering phone trying sonce 4 05 can't reservation online. Can't reach anyone txfrring hotel operator. Left voicemail no reply yet. No answering Group Sales line.  Suck Oscar's town guests want check downtown they're hoping good steak.  we'll Triple Geo Nugget apparently you've gone business! Oscars yesterday Valentine's Day 2016 bf.  restaurant really nice staff really friendly top things which loved.  BUT....the food bad .  mash potatoes watery.....The creamy Spinach didn't no flavor.  Mac cheese more creamy fettuccini.  bf's prime rib no flavor all. disappointing.  said place really nice friendly staff but no food....specially if ur paying $200. feel customer if your paying lot money food needs point.  unfortunately attending Oscar any time soon. second visit Oscars.  becoming new tradition attend show Smith Center then Oscars dinner.  Beef Booze Broads....so three party four steak chicken artichokes all booze....However broad looked little tired failed stop table wish good dining experience.  beef excellent beef eaters all ordered Joey C's filet served Oscar lump crab asparagus Béarnaise sauce.  steaks tender cooked perfection.  béarnaise best eaten both taste temperature consistency.  melted perfectly into beef.  Chicken artichokes good well however sauce served bit salty.  

We ordered mashed potatoes excellent creamed spinach sides table.  None cared creamed spinach cream very creamy.  wish gone sautéed spinach.

So why did only give place three......the waiter gentleman long grayish hair pulled back ponytail superior condescending attitude.  locals travel dine extensively.  seek dining experiences while food excellent waiter really put damper otherwise excellent evening.

It started when member party asked which steak better waiter attitude kind chuckled such 'stupid question said whichever best .  very helpful then he acted perturbed diner tried decide which get....

One member party saw onion rings served another table asked waiter attitude please bring some table.  served when entrees came but figured since ordered them little later would come later...That wasn't case waiter attitude never did stop back see if wanted anything...

Because waiter attitude decided fore desert...We back Oscars but specifically request seated waiter attitude's section......If he still there....... Nothing special. 

Got filet mignon rare which very tender cooked perfectly...I just wish bit more bloody. Haha. flavor alright. 

Also added side king crab legs. $20 basically two crabs legs which split half. wasn't even really good. Texture seemed fresh but still lacked flavor even addition lemon juice butter salt. better tasting crab buffet $20 worth it. 

Other people table ordered New York steak which decent again cooked right temperature. flavor okay well albeit wasn't anything spectacular. If expecting splurge piece meat knock your socks off isn't it. 

We also ordered mushrooms onions three steaks. total $24 mushrooms $15 onions 3 orders each .  mushrooms okay again nothing special but onions wayyyy sweet. Now love prefer grilled caramelized onions raw onions because sweetness but onions whole 'nother level sweet. Nobody table even wanted second bite. uh yeah mushrooms onions complete waste money. 

Our bill ended over $250 wasn't all that...at all. looking forward going eat Oscar's dads favorite restaurants before being remodeled renamed. All say don't eat there. steaks husband dad ordered both rare when ordered medium. am vegetarian forced pay $25 plate squash asparagus smallest stalks ever seen half stewed tomato. wish manager would cared but all he told grill gets overworked end night doesn't cook steaks right. waiter okay but whole experience made realize attending Oscar's again. If you're going dinner amazing steak skip place Capital Grille instead. King crab legs fishy.  sent them back.  Shuttle supposed take Smith Center show never came. Oscar's several times keep going back because food service fantastic.  very attentive but overly so.  view downtown amazing restaurant  although bummer new zip line blocks good portion not restaurant's fault any means .

I always filet mignon butterflied well done perfectly!  garlic mashed potatoes asparagus delicious sides well.  dinners just good. husband ordered salmon don't even fish but looked delicious well.

 only thing don't care bread  it scallions stuff inside I'd rather plain bread.

If Vegas place worth eating at. Wifey stopped Oscars drink some appetizers before exploring Fremont Street. tucked away 2nd floor Plaza Hotel private setting. bartender point advised happy hour drinks half off. 
Their drink selection fair ranging Coors lights IPAS martinis champagne whiskey vodka mixed drinks. also ordered few appetizers which made quickly extremely tasty. 
While bar advised if want return dinner its best reservation. turned sound advice. Saturday its happening place. 
Give shot. Live piano music great view great steaks great romantic atmosphere. disappointed. husband wanting try Oscar's made reservation celebrate birthday noted reservation. No reception desk when arrived  when she returned she ignored phone another young woman seated us checking reservation no smile no welcome no Happy Birthday .  husband's rib eye excellent entree good. waiter Bobby attentive poor service  did check food delivered etc. bus person Alfredo most courteous friendly helpful staff member restaurant. agreed wouldn't back locals many great restaurants Valley put poor service. 2 trips place. first trip pork chop lobster bisque bottle shiraz.  Awesome. Tonight second trip.  ordedred cedar plank salmon.  don't think really wanted salmon but menu item restaurant used work at.  think really wanted piece past chew on.  miss Ted's salmon even more bison burgers.  miss having reguars.  think miss most co workers made mediocre chain restaurant into place gave smile bad days.  Sharing line kitchen parking lot breaks Raul Paris playing mfm bffs hiding weird places scare people all table 1 talks.  salmon ate did take there. think wasn't smokey enough. Oscar's two girlfriends tonite based mediocre reviews Yelp pleasantly surprised.  pretty room circular most everyone decent view.  moment seated server Frankie attentive but pushy helper also.  told weren't hurry didn't want rushed timing entire meal just perfect.  water glasses refilled regularly without asking Frankie friendly charming attitude just added pleasantness evening.  all very pleased food onion bread great I loved lobster bisque steaks done perfectly.

The waiters dressed crisp black white striped shirts black ties looked great!  saw some very attractive young women seating customers but no one would call broad .  kind disappointing wanted see broads .  Pictures walls same pictures covering walls Oscar's office hallway while he Mayor very interesting if haven't seen them before!

It nice having live music during dinner pianist bar area music soft enough dining room uninterrupted conversation.

Overall enjoyed whole experience looking forward next visit. Look going lie  skeptical.  Very skeptical.  might even say scared.  Other Yelp reviewers torn place apart.  But hubby heart set Oscar Goodman's name sake made reservations Valentine's Day.  all honesty really enjoyed myself!  sure why some other horrendous reviews.

Yes review long but trying help others.  Here's see it Service 2 1 2 stars. While hope Oscar's management takes whole review heart area need take most seriously.  waiter nice enough but best ever had.  Both hostesses those front desk check reservations those seat guests bussing staff well lackluster  hard read way.  Quite honestly two best staff members met during evening general manager circulating room food runner always came smile.  those complaints other reviewers say waiter never seen between order bill  apparently didn't dine same restaurant because friendly all staff present.  agree however all staff could use afternoon seminar smiling saying Yes. Food 3 1 2 stars.  food itself more 4 stars I am clueless poor reviewers eating  most everything wonderful but menu selection gets them knocked down 1 2 if full star book.  never steakhouse doesn't least pasta dish menu because steak fan hubby fanatic pasta always order.  However Oscar's does single one.  When inquired waiter if pasta request could accomodated I know share kitchen sister restaurant Italian Simpatico shoudn't impossible. he stated could see Simpatico menu but if wanted order off would re seated room.   ridiculous!  husband wants Oscar's menu both want appetizers desserts your menu all asking pasta entree kitchen.  already even viewed Simpatico menu going order most expensive dishes! Pricier ended ordering off Oscar's real menu oh well your loss bigger check Mr. Waiter. Anyway pieced together dinner myself.  started lobster bisque  5 stars!  atypical delicious!  large pieces lobster which never served before when order dish other restaurants.  Then crab cake appetizer entree side sweet potato fries.  4 1 2 stars crab cakes  very little filler lots lump crab meat.  3 1 2 stars fries  delicious sprinkle them generously cinnamon sugar mixture.  husband started caesar salad then cedar planked salmon baked potato.  words all three items solid 4's.  both agreed  the free onion bread  5 stars all way!!!!  disappointment dessert.  ordered triple chocolate mousse which food runner called triple chocolate cake he delivered house doesn't even know is arrived still partly frozen.  Sorry Oscar's but please jump off thawed pre made desserts bandwagon your own.  Even if specialized just two could recommend those customers rest pre made.

Decor Ambience 4 1 2 stars.  Near perfect. Old School Vegas husband calls both hoping for.  many places Las Vegas nowadays some hip interior designer's idea new fancy. place time don't wrong but really enjoy occasionally going place feel stepped back time.  Oscar's definitely upscale fashionable decor faux croc upholstered booths metallic chairs couches but still feels classic cliche may said old school. only caveat way music competes. live piano player bar which great area's ambience.  However play canned music dining room because restaurant huge when dining hear both.  only overly loud atmosphere hearing waiter your dining companion hard but annoying due two different battling tunes.  If anything Oscar's would skip piped music.

Final note  floating Broads Unnecessary tacky.  didn't approach assuming because Valentine's Day but there.  just find insulting Oscar's believes women appropriate restaurant should catering couples quite bit money spend nice date night out. Worth every cent! wonderful dinner can't wait back. atmosphere great huge bar area live music dining room itself glass dome overlooking Fremont St. definitely great view. server Lenore awesome. started house made ricotta which came toast tomato caper relish. fantastic. Caesar salad very good. ordered filet Bearnaise sauce cooked perfection. Husband ordered crab stuffed jumbo shrimp he loved them. ordered selection 3 sides corn brûlée baked potato macaroni cheese. all great. Lenore made some great suggestions dessert ended chocolate mousse apple crisp vanilla ice cream. Perfect ending outstanding meal. Highly recommend! Viva Las Vegas. If want true Las Vegas dining experience EXCELLENT food Oscar's your place. great atmosphere old Las Vegas waking through Plaza casino you're prepared night enjoyment food music laughter. 

We group colleagues wonderful time. Larry live musician fantastic. service impeccable food...amazing. ordered Bone in Tomahawk Ribeye  42 oz amazing meat. Ok ordered share still brought home plenty another meal. meat top quality cooked juicy red medium rare perfection. 

It's cheapest place town but always say pay .  If want cheap nasty other end Fremont eat Heart Attack Grill. You'll regret afterward . 

To top off evening Hizzonor Mayor Goodman himself house!  certainly WON'T regret spending extra enjoying yourself Oscar's. Service outstanding! hostesses bussers servers bartender. Food great filets cooked perfectly rare order shared mushrooms mac cheese. top all off dinner ran into man himself dinner bar. He gracious host take picture him. Job well done Oscar. last Friday night.  being sat server failed come 15 minutes I timed watch. telling specials server left without offering drink.  When server returned he took food order took wife's drink order left.  called back order drink he gave attitude.  When he returned he brought wrong wine wife told drink ordered sold out.  food came took server another 20 minutes check us.  Spiolotro steak medium tasted piece fat burned outside basted olive oil.  server forgot wife's side dish asparagus until meal almost finished.  When bill came server failed change drink actually received which changed price check.    eaten almost every steakhouse strip probably worst experience all them. September 22 2014. 7 45pm Amazing meal usual however 15 years going last visit. bank locked card fraud protection instead Oscars verifying state issued ID making copy charging next  day manager Jason Gordon retrieved Plaza security promptly arrived immediately threatened arrested FELONY charges!!! finally kept ID drivers license let return hotel but only tried ask date if she could pay. effectively stopped entire night strip state ID. Thanks Oscar! Delicious.  Best crab cakes ever had.  Sweet potato wedges delectable.  cedar smoked salmon absolutely perfect.  only complaint not really would way much food.  Did expect proportions quite large.  crab cakes sweet potato wedges would more enough me.  But then would wonderful salmon.  ambiance relaxing quiet view Fremont st.  Gave eardrums break.  definitely eat again. killed ourselves appetizers.  crab cakes world.  Drink prices weren't bad either.  wife's filet absolutely perfect prime rib cooked just asked somewhere between merely stunned medium rare .  staff very friendly professional.  Food prices kind high but still tad lower Lawry's.  place worth trip. husband recently visited Las Vegas first time decided tourists Fremont desiring see Old Vegas Fremont Street Experience.  reading reviews various restaurants downtown decided try Oscar's.  may best experience during entire visit each Filet Oscar over top chopped salad creamed spinach.  Everything delectable huge thumbs chopped salad!!  

Our server turned sommelier extremely courteous prompt very knowledgeable when came assisting choosing perfect wine pair meal food service exceptional.

The atmosphere perfect Old Vegas really encompasses glitz glam would expect.  husband put perfectly when he said he expected Dean Martin walk cigarette martini hand!! view Fremont Street piano player laid back lounge feel just perfect.  

In closing say anyone visiting Vegas should miss Oscar's!! Truly top notch place!! Bar review only glad say went...the view nice service attentive but martinis sub par! ordered chocolate martini swear used Hershey's syrup instead Godiva husband order extra olive juice dirty martini...it clear straight vodka! BEST crab cakes ever!!! Thanks Jeff fulfilling taste buds dreams. Oh always bow down wicked talents Steve bartender. Thanks Oscar opening such great place eat drink surprising conversation random strangers. happy hour before concert Smith Center. appetizers regular half price drinks. crab cakes large excellent. Same Burrata Tomato salad which wasn't HH menu. prime rib sliders also very good.
The service excellent return regular dinner here. Worst service long time already low expectations bad service Vegas. server rude downright mean group. food terrible. Burnt steaks overpriced appetizers no flavour expensive. view nice overlooking Fremont  only reason place gets 1 star. Oscar's opened several years ago good helping razzle dazzle sizzle. When entering restaurant experience much entering different era politically incorrect refreshing amidst landscape generic dining establishments think Applebee's TGI Friday's. But unfortunately Oscar's sizzle now reduced mere fizzle know way January 2nd feels like.... reception less stellar dare arrive 5 minutes before your planned reservation time unless don't mind having wait extra 5 minutes anyway because folks clock watchers. view Fremont Street permanently obstructed ridiculous Zipline monstrosity but could fault restaurant that? service great luckily those standards relaxed but food mediocre best. Prime rib lackluster lacking taste colder expected medium cut although medium rare ordered. Mayor Carolyn please stop sample cut named would suspect would preferred order chicken dinner instead. Ahi tuna peppercorn encrusted  all tasted Peppercorns hint flavor tuna found. side dish asparagus room temperature ho hum. But biggest disappointment obvious lack broads really would made dining experience any more enjoyable but hey!  advertised good reason thought. summary beef great Booze okay but isn't everywhere else? Broads well around when there. guess need day off too. But whole restaurant itself taken day off. O long good ol' days sizzle! first all place very cold air conditioner sadly prime ribs.  prime ribs clearly re heated left over meat.  outside dark visible fresh cut.  No visible sign pink red meat all medium rare prime rib.   embarrassment asked clients come try place.  prime ribs horrible.  

The servers great but prime ribs.  huge disappointment!! Very nice place  great view Fremont street   Steaks great sides excellent.   Dessert so.   Would goneb5 stars if dress code some music. Came happy hour few friends! Very disappointing. drinks food menu wasn't anything great actually drinks pricey HH $10 13 only wells beer house red white 1 2 price. GF wanted vodka but told no HH prices other well drinks?? ordered beef sliders beef dry even au jus wasn't great $12! Must beef night before! Calamari just ok better other places Capital Grille! dinner great!!  disappointed isn't place happy hour!! restaurant such cool spot. Yes strip line does interfere view. Try dark see lights. service excellent. food awful. didn't even eat mine. tried four menu items. boyfriend ate steak but agreed wasn't very good. hope something changes regards food. would love back if knew food better. just give place 5 stars because more just another tasty steak place. Plaza which even remotely attractive but valet right off Main easy restaurant. When escalators enter Oscar's walking into totally different place old carpet smoke down casino floor. bar staff friendly food delicious price wallet friendly Las Vegas steak place standards. tons Vegas kitsch DeNiro impersonator night which whole reason even bother downtown. honestly say wouldn't hesitate eat again. might even bring town guests but only if good sense humor. Great service quickly brought food. Ambiance great. little disappointed prime rib though place supposed beef. love love restrant ! 
Food big n yummy ! 
and service Nice ! nothing complaing ! 
i def going back again * .?. o o .?. * presentation shrimp cocktail looked something diner. Caesar's salad bland. Prime rib good but very fatty cut meat more fatty other prime rib steaks other steakhouses. Creamed spinach very good. Skipped dessert.
We late staff ok but seemed wanted rush home last tables seated evening.. 
View nice but wont back recommend. Dined wife great experience. drink beautiful bar then dinner overlooking Fremont street. Service friendly server very knowledgeable. Food great loved ribeye oscar topped!! Great evening!! back! food good but exceptional Scott waiter. He way 11 year old happy stopped converse drawing. Never felt rushed! Nice view Fremont street show while enjoying air conditioning expecting all vintage vegas hype. Yes photos Mayor wall few others but bottom line room generic WHITE SHEER CURTAINS  windows !! think still waiting really ordered !!
The bar really bright reminded coffee shop lighting. baby grand right middle bar area but even though Saturday night nobody playing it.
The food just okay. Lobster bisque brown. NEVER seen brown bisque before watery.
Skirt steak whole cloves raw garlic pushed into meat if forgot then added last minute. came literally tablespoon worst mashed potatoes ever tasted.
No need but fact if Mayor's name wasn't place would empty !! week party three girls spring break accidentally stumbled into Oscar's Steakhouse Monday evening dinner restaurant end Fremont Street. dining experience certainly highlight trip. food phenomenal. BEST artichoke appetizer any ever tasted hands down! Also rest items ordered did fail all amazing.  However true highlight evening server Nick. He all right suggestions all right places. Additionally he shared over experience over 40 years Vegas history care dining experience refreshing delightful. Words can't describe fun passion care into food service atmosphere. look forward return Vegas family visit Oscar's...to see Nick hear more stories enjoy food fun. THANK YOU!!! loved food everything just nice good time staff hostess very friendly. salmon flavor delicious everything wonderful except server pony tail he just rude attitude! Upon arrival host very attentive friendly sat right away..we did reservations.  four table view Fremont experience.  ordered new York strips filet garlic mashed potatoes steak fries corn brûlée asparagus French onion soup.  soup sides better steaks....steaks cooked right but price but same quality steak Costco lot less.  onion bread butter also very good.  steakhouse oscar's experience fine dining. Service waiter would Denny's.  wave down he did come check empty glasses....you fine dining experience if going spend$$$$ elsewhere. best steakhouses unsuspecting area would imagine Vegas. None Less Fremont Street. Diamond Rough. Best kept secret great prices great service. Surf turf excellent 3 pieces filet 8 9 shrimp top. Corn brûlée side delicious. 

For starters crab cakes very good. Wife salmon very pleased one small bone kept being completely satisfied . 

Would definitely recommend. Bobby adequate personable server. friends looking swanky yet informal restaurant which dine when stumbled upon few olfactorily mention visually auspicious venues downtown area Las Vegas.  Oscar's invited via its sophisticated leather bound bar stools perfect lighting.  perusing extensive wine list bar lucky escorted into main dining area which resembled glass dome atrium which allowed diners see everything Main Street feel though dining top skyscraper.  While basking ethereal beauty dome all remained puzzled restaurant's gregarious tagline Beef Booze Broads which am ashamed admit another factor getting eat intriguing establishment.  Thinking tagline simply referred finer things life taken surprise when tipsy showgirl sashayed over table whose bosoms lips artificially enhanced much she seemed constant danger falling over.  Utterly pleased Oscar's thusfar come through its promise broads bravely tackled menu experience beef booze.  deciding bottle Spanish Tempranillo decided order melange dishes table share.  difficult choose decided order Spilotro Style Flat Iron steak Alaskan King crab legs Cedar Plank Blackened salmon few orders Cardini's Two Bit Caesar salad Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac Cheese Steamed Asparagus Broccoli Ralph's Smashed potatoes.  steak perfectly cooked medium rare state requested came brimming delicious bits barely cooked garlic which might turn off your average garlic consumer but reveled its fiery goodness. crab legs moist fresh tempted order another serving because through first quickly.  salmon cooked perfection all watched tenderly flake onto forks each bite brimming its natural juices. being huge fan mac cheese prepared little opinion dish but pleasantly surprised see pasta swimming cheese sauce but appropriately baked cheese cream pasta actually taken some delicate cheese flavors especially something reminded smokey gouda... c'est si bon!  broccoli asparagus barely steamed perhaps blanched? which exactly should served acted healthy palate cleansers.  Did forget mention Tempranillo?  divine.  Each sip reminiscent lazy sunny days spent spanish countryside... tannic acidic definitely fruity. finished off feast espresso cappuccinos tiramisu table share.  coffee exquisite balanced delicate richness house made tiramisu.  Overall colleagues thoroughly enjoyed experience would return heartbeat.  Bravo Oscar! Fantastic steakhouse. Incredible tender ribeye wife filet. Both could cut fork. But better meal service waiter Brad. Brad top drawer if he any indication other servers need here. Excellent meal. Best crab cake! Lived Spilatro Steak. Hubbys filet perfect. Nick server awesome charming. We'll back ! friend if ours celebrating 55th birthday. made online reservation mentioning occasion Wow! table right front Freemont street Experience lights great pictures. food excellent service wonderful. end evening Duo playing music being filtered into restaurant sang happy birthday mentioned name too! He also free piece birthday cake. wish celebrated birthday there.

The only sad thing which nit reflection Oscars enforce dress code. dressed nines among jeans t shirt tourists. long old time Vegas thought Oscars advertises kind image might think dress code. 

I would again still dress Love it..... Always when Vegas.  Great food great drinks.  Located old Vegas great view!  Staff very friendly professional helpful. amazing night here. staff way sure enjoyed classic steak dinner.  Loved vibe.  More people should here.  drinks bit pricey shame Plaza Casino Hotel isn't more enjoyable atmosphere great restaurant. Great happy hour . atmosphere awesome.If you're downtown want sit nice bar friendly service your place .
If you're dine won't disappointed. Loved food view just best. Really fantastic steaks shellfish platter however leaves something desired.  nearly $50 half frozen king crab leg which still frozen when 2 oysters 2 jumbo Shrimp half lobster tail stuck shell also still frozen when received 1 other shellfish.  definitely impressed that.  side ordered SHMULEY'S EXTRAORDINARY MAC CHEESE which hands down best EVER had.. am mac cheese Snob.  food overall very good.   Waiter didn't give correct dessert but rather 'to go' replacement without ever informing me.   Neither great.  If offered complimentary meal poor Expensive experience seafoodand switching dessert I'd happily back drop another 300$ but honestly without acknowledgement don't think would bother.  another 3 days Plaza hotel thought going back mac cheese but sure justify hubby. lol first time very good! all enjoyed drinks appetizers filets. only part disappointed 3 sides ordered mac cheese Brussels sprouts bacon  mashed potatoes all lacked any flavor. say waiter Bradley amazing great sense humor! Loved he made night really fun!!! definitely going back!! First time staying Fremont St.  Wanted upscale place birthday dinner.  Great service.  Asked nice table when made reservation beautiful window front.  Can't see down Fremont because zip line but view awesome anyway.  Filet cooked perfectly.  Mac cheese die for.  Skip au gratin better.  brought free cheesecake birthday.  All all fantastic dinner. Tried place couple weeks ago.  filet really good sides decent.  reason giving 3 stars because setting.  really different place.  Vegas Flamingo girls walking around restaurant trying talk while you're eating.  give run down Old Vegas good'ol mobster days.  kind interesting but annoying same time.  just eat expecting show.

The food delicious well portioned.  kind pricey. Oh gosh nightmare. drink appetizer before concert Smith Center. Margarita served ws horrible could even drink it. even little. Yuck! ordered shrimp cocktails shrimp stunk room!!!! Really ?you serve lethal shrimp your customers?. send stinky mess back. No way anyone going eat cr*p. Just because happy hour doesn't mean try rid food ththat's going garbage! 
If wasn't enough waitress brings ginormous bill. Oh she forgot take off shrimp oh she forgot charge half price drinks due Happy Hour .
Scandalous really scandalous. Shame them. Expected more Oscars.! If looking fantastic steak come Oscar's. Both mine husband's outstanding! Brad waiter Above Beyond service. food fantastic definitely come back future Ended having dinner Oscar's inside Plaza last night.   food amazing but when closing minute.   let sit bar doors locked served dinner full set up.   excellent company Nick bartender Justin manager.  left full happy vowing come back during regular hours.   #Oscars #PlazaHotel #DowntownVegas If rate place personal experience would given four stars. view restaurant amazing inside out french onion soup absolutely amazing. chicken artichoke mashed potatoes entree again amazing. only thing would cost restaurant star broccoli side unfortunately came cold very cold being steamed broccoli.

Sadly am rating groups experience. party 8. everything well start. Drinks calamari perfectly fried greasy all salads soup. 7 salads came wrong dressing big deal salad eaten anyways. when entrees came whole dinner downhill. 8 entrees only 4 came right. 2 guests each ordered dinner special 22oz ribeye presented prime rib guested ordered filet mignon well done butterfly cut received filet but since wasn't butterflied still very red center. Another guests prime rib topped sauteed mushrooms came mushrooms cold. not mention 2 other orders broccoli 1 asparagus order also coming cold The manager quickly table apologizing ensuring food would recooked...Which was. First came new orders broccoli asparagus guests ate just veggies while waited meat wanting broccoli cold second time. Since 22oz ribeye filet rather big pieces meat took long time brought correct temperatures guests waiting While rest ate presented shrimp cocktail. nice gesture but appetizers salads those even liked shrimp getting full just wanted meal. 

Finally food came back 2 beautiful ribeyes Which tastes amazing . Unfortunately again filet came butterflied cut but STILL very red center acceptable waiting 30+ minutes made second time. offered desserts house but those ate all full other half group just wanted restaurant. asked check split 3 ways again many problems which understand am server splitting checks pain but impossible! Finally another 20 minutes checks figured could go.

I would back restaurant again just maybe large group. Oscar's proves don't dine Strip great meal.  several times definitely back more.  

The chopped salad fantastic meal itself.  more your typical chopped salad great texture candied pecans onion strings.  

The chicken soup just so so.  didn't eat most wouldn't order again.

The lobster tail incredible.  order add on any other entree.  guests ordered steak lobster tail entree.  wish could order lobster itself if two both want lobster nothing else it.  perhaps waiters accommodate but menu clearly states add lobster entree.  

The side dish combinations also good selection.  pick any 3 sides $15.  mac cheese creamed spinach baked potato.  All delicious.  also ordered Ahi sashimi appetizer didn't disappoint.

The view dome incredible.  reservation dinner when Fremont Street Experience light show ask sit near window.  won't hear music but see great light show possibly some interesting characters!  Oscar's also some fantastic live music bar entertain sip cocktails.  

Buxom ladies walk around visit your table hence broads Beef Booze Broads .  kind corny slightly uncomfortable but won't hold against Oscar's.  Vegas known being refined classy place.  If sequinned silicone'd vixens going fit anywhere Vegas. Place amazing!! wonderful time Thursday night everything great app all way dessert even ambiance great Jeff chef made experience more enjoyable ever! definitely coming back!! second visit there. Nice environment. View Fremont good. Carolyn's Cut prime rib. delish! Waiter just okay. Sunday night no broads last time broads. bread served onion bread. liked but he doesn't onions he luck. would back! Sandy 24th wedding anniversary. She ordered Filet Mignon Oscar cut bone in Prime Rib. meat outstanding both us. Perfectly cooked. Sides French onion soup chopped salad sides mushrooms sweet potatoes fine too. search 3 things town. 

1. Good Service 
2. Better tasting food then friends cook home. 
3. final bill line entire experience.

After eating Oscar's Steakhouse Wednesday say still looking! 

I'll start service.  
We arrived just before 6pm quickly seated main room amazing view. booth sat little higher then tables really made feel special. However looking back can't imagine being sat anywhere else because...we only people there. other words entire restaurant ours! Before bottom seat waiter Frank helper David right service asking if first time Oscar's. tried remove jackets find comfortable position booth Frank kept charging history restaurant long distinguished service career waiter. arm coming jacket found David waving menu face look at. Two seconds later Frank ready take order. stepping over Franks conversation working during Johnson administration found self raising voice notify would look over menu first while. Once he finally left table couldn't help but laugh amount excitement must brought place. only people eat days. Franks willingness drop table chat many travels waiter never seemed tire. stands Frank down kindest pushiest waiter ever had. took time put most memorable interactions below. 

1.
Frank ready order .
My girlfriend Just few more moments please Frank Well order now because going busy soon girlfriend Oh 2.
Frank would miss ?
My girlfriend take flank steak Frank sure ?
My girlfriend Yes Frank know flank steak ?
My girlfriend Yes Frank know chewy girlfriend Chewy ?
Frank Ya Chewy hard eat girlfriend  good way describe steak Frank Well truth Now food
After being forced into girlfriend filet mignon $32 tried veal $40 . also decided side asparagus $9 another well poured martini $17 . Once table became apparent kitchen also unnecessary hurry. Because presentation terrible. steak alone plate veal just opposite  pouring over plate! top extra large portion pound greens sloppily covered breaded veal. fished down forest greens cut bite lost ended cutting bite fat. Once mouth quickly noticed wasn't meat spit plate. Then took another bite....it tasted exactly same first!! seems breading thick all could taste grease cooked in. Needless say could cook veal better myself girlfriends steak small but good. However she definitely cook better steak home well. Nothing food worth going back for. 

About bill
To sum all up...this place need some direction managment handle kitchen putting control service staff. feels spend more time name dishes then anything else. food tasteless presentation comical staff pushy.  great name great location amazing potential but obvious repeat business priority.  
Here free advise First step lower prices. food better then friends cook home don't charge more then $17.00 your most expensive meal. 
Second drop la carte crap include some sides each meal. 
Finally add table wine won't break bank people fun let loose without spending paycheck drinks. enjoyed cocktail bar area before dinner. pretty room service good. Lucky Bobby waiter he excellent! He knowledgeable menu made some great recommendations. He made great meal even better!! Cheers! Located Fremont heart downtown Oscar's still keeps old Vegas feel.

The menu simple point you're delicious steaks. Sides la carte table shared sweet potatoes asparagus mac cheese. crab stuffed shrimp appy ribeye Oscar sauce hollandaise seafood both dishes unbelievable heavy rich but totally worth it It overwhelming when trying find somewhere eat Vegas because there's many places choose but pay extra money quality food service would Oscar's. Service dining room just bad especially restaurant supposed quality. Food mediocre best. local familiar many fine restaurants Vegas know won't return.

Don't there. many other great alternatives such Vic Anthony's Golden Nugget Del Frisco's Paradise Ave. both 2 best city Brand Monte Carlo Strip House Planet Hollywood Botero Encore Wynn. You'll much more your money all many others. took friends Oscars 10th wedding anniversary.  made reservations week ahead time able time wanted.  showed Sunday night 30 minutes before reservation.  seated bar area drink before table ready.  female bartender rude snobby.  offered seat 15 minutes before reservation time.  seated waiter very friendly attentive.  party four ordered appetizers steak chicken.  Every thought food amazing.  little expensive but would eat again pay asking price food great.  Three four dessert everyone agreed dessert amazing well. stopped bar cocktails appetizers hitting mob museum.  bartender friendly made great Aviator.  ordered crab cakes which fabulous shrimp cocktail huge tasty beef tartare just OK underseasoned dry.  ambience fab just expecting Oscar.  piano player guitarist topped off old Vegas style experience.  Dining room seemed packed tourists Saturday night glad chilled bar. heavy heart write review Oscar's.  most Las Vegans adore former mayor. want everything Oscar Goodman touches turn gold. such high regard taste restaurant least mind should best steakhouses town.

As stands tell people avoid it.  short case raw gratin potatoes say certainly won't back Oscar's. 

This second trip Oscars when visited last year enjoyed steaks sides. While did love any taken ambiance style use space no question would back.  no other place city  they serve great drinks iconic space. manages capture glamorous feeling old Vegas. 

We didn't see any broads visit but can't help but enjoy view established feeling all. 

The problem return trip food. Period. fairness came steakhouse ate salmon feel free disregard comments but experiences speak overall level quality. 

Here's thing   while satisfied piece fish hubby pleased fillet no else happy quality protein. friend shrimp dish found shrimp overcooked friends prime rib stated and visually obvious presented temperatures requested.

Those things could overlook ready overlook even talked laughed ate but snafu side dish am still shocked by. au gratin disaster.  received pale looking item small ramekin type dish. first scoop when hit table cool. completely ice cold but slightly cooler room temperature.  piece melted cheese dish. Even top creamy white chopped mix. no sprinkle yellow bunt orange crusty brown anywhere. still took bite because brain hadn't processed wrong dish. flavor disconcerting  it bitter. chewed offered bite another table mate second opinion. She agreed something wrong dish but neither spent much time thinking ate.  

We celebrating night didn't want think potatoes were...crunchy toothsome fact seemed no cheese. Before waitress came pick dishes stated table thought dish might raw. But conversation shifting Occam's razor full effect talked myself ridiculous guess. celebrating Brad's birthday didn't want spend any more time bemoaning weak dish. People dissatisfied enough main dishes already eaten didn't want add anyone's dissatisfaction.

But raw gratin kept gnawing me. wrong? served potatoes? When home through some Yelp photos others' experiences looking specifically picture au gratin potatoes. count number times ordered and or eaten them didn't trust clear voice telling ugly truth.

 look Dennis T's pic yellow golden cheesy crust clearly baked dish provided all evidence needed case raw gratin . absolutely served raw au gratin. 

Add fact hubby asked Diet Coke served Diet Pepsi. don't fault them serving Pepsi products but why didn't server stop clarify time order placed?  

Mid meal manager came asked everything was. awkward few moments silence friend stated flatly OK. manager never followed up. 

Mistakes happen certainly forgivable. But mistake unnoticed  means someone kitchen put them raw expediter and or secondary server saw them found them acceptable served use placed table raw pale anemic . Then when finished waitress saw generally untouched pure white raw gratin never said word. 

That's problem me. easily forgive raw dish casual diner although never served one mom pop spot although never served one . But upscale steakhouse tailored meet tastes even most discerning diners . 

In fairness Oscar's called let manger know issue next day.  But damage done. breakdown both food preparation service. many great steakhouses town seek another experience Oscar's. Burt says Oscars Beef Booze Broads. that's really logo Old Vegas style!!!

Finally restaurant  afraid use seasoning.  

The food top notch.  But  very good restaurant really cool room sure sit Dome Room don't even go . old Vegas atmosphere charming.  view straight down Fremont Street great other new Zip line ride blocking view under construction.  does guy used mayor married current mayor allow Zip line block view own restaurant?  guessing when construction completed wont obtrusive..........Or else.  

The Prime rib extra tasty.  Burt's hint Order degree under would usually order at.  

Mom ordered Schnitzel loved it. Also Caroline cocktail.  Burt's broad ordered Halibut.  She didn't love but if ask Burt hell broad ordering Halibut steakhouse?  

For side sure order corn.  great.  mac cheese au gratin potatoes OK.  

Good cappuccino very good chocolate moose.  NY style cheesecake good.

Again greatest food.  But very good whole experience fun. great time Oscar's. Nice dining room elevated street views. steaks outstanding perfectly seasoned cooked.  Loved roasted corn brulee. Logistics first parked Plaza self parking lot just south hotel entrance.  pay $5 cash then ticket validated refund later casino cashier cage.  walk little long just use valet parking if go.
The restaurant lovely really did enjoy view.  weren't any broads seen but people watching Freemont great.
Overall food mostly good.   starters chopped salad crab cakes.  love good salad but it.  avocado perfectly ripe but under seasoned.  Everything piled together very creamy bland heap.  salad also large pieces fresh herb became overpowering when bit into it.  both bland overpowering.  know contradiction but is.
The crab cakes delicious large chunks crab just barely held together.
My NY strip cooked perfectly fabulous crust.  Though wish hadn't opted au poivre sauce.  shared corn brulee side which good.
The cheesecake good don't bother.
Service friendly but extremely rushed.  second course arrive while still eating first course.  Then started clearing dishes while still eating steak.  When he asked take plate told give few minutes but really shouldn't if am holding silverware still chewing.  again arrived bill while still dessert.
I fun time watching old Vegas work steak quite good long know hat getting might enjoy.  long eat fast. great steakhouse downtown Vegas.  gets 4 stars.  Highlights were incrediballs view Fremont Street dusk. Friendly waiters cool ambiance. Oscar's awesome collection photos celebrities walk in. best crab cakes outside Baltimore.

The Lowlight place Booze its name yet glass wine which came delivered little carafe BARELY 5 oz. if that.  Hey Oscar you're chargin' fer glass 'bout nice big pour?  

Other wine stinginess strongly recommend place.  Probably nicest place dinner Downtown Las Vegas! friend came late Thursday eat Simpatico restaurant  behind hidden door within Oscar's. hostesses super nice even though friend fairly confused where exactly restaurant was. only people portion restaurant it 9 15 close 10 . servers friendly quick very helpful. couple salads pastas. onion bread nice hot salads fresh pastas delicious. prices also pretty reasonable. said staff Simpatico also circulating through Oscar's. experience absolutely wonderful while can't comment much steakhouse portion if you're want good meal Simpatico really nice prices better. Scored Travelzoo $99.00 certificate spend $165.00.  Made reservation couple weeks ago tonight worth wait.
We arrived just couple minutes before reservation immediately greeted two beautiful young ladies.  show wife table immediately started service. waited delightful young lady name Tasha bus boy assistant Alfredo. both cheery nice around.  Both great sense humor. wife started off Vesper Martini Laphroaig scotch neat ice cube. Drinks arrived very quickly.  Then eating began crab cake calamari appetizers both very good.  ordered stuffed shrimp wife ordered Oscar style bone prime rib.  ordered caramelized onions blue cheese prime.  Both very good but just way much onions.  blue cheese spectacular.  also sides Brussels sprouts bacon along clean face onion rings.  constantly checked Tasha Alfredo.  also couple visits manager also executive chef hotel.  Didn't name but he very nice.

We topped meal off sharing  Tiramisu.  absolutely best ever had.

All all just wonderful meal evening.  Want back night happy hour. white marble floor live piano music greet patrons new downtown restaurant.  Main seating under glass dome roof second floor.  fantastic view straight down Fremont Experience entertains during meal.  don't eat meat but friends said excellent.  seafood choices wonderful especially salmon which melts mouth.  Prices $25 entrees.  Caesar salad $7 huge delicious added anchovies me.  casino typical downtown bit run down.  But Oscar's new elegant view pure Las Vegas neon.  don't endure walking through lot smoke there. happy hour wonderful! crab cakes amazing! wish cocktail server duty which why gave only four stars. bar tenders great made excellent cocktails very nice personalities. upscale restaurant cocktail server underplays classy vibe. fact 2 hostesses appeared empty dining room standing podium chatting another seemed bit wasted resources when bar 15 people very busy bar tenders never stopped working.
It Tuesday super crowded but did leave lounge area seating bar place order. carried own cocktails back seating area but food delivered. 
Like mentioned before crab cakes amazing. calamari crispy full flavor the sauce calamari anything rave ahi wonderful served delicious pickles.
Will back? bet! am Looking forward those crab cakes! view incredible food amazing while still affordable! staff amazing great selection wine. really loved experience here! tried place when first opened wonderful meal extremely attentive service. when needed place book large birthday party tried Oscar's again confident we'd made good choice. NOT! disaster start. opening time could busy yet entire experience worst every way. first round drinks then try several times server's attention refills. wine steward dripped wine all over table guest's flatware which she removed never replaced. Despite server's assurances he could accomodate some minor changes entree instructions ignored. Several people received entirely wrong meals. vegetables served cold. people incorrectly served prime rib instead nightly special given horseradish sauce however person actually did order prime rib given any. Seems minor detail but prices attention detail should #1. spent entire evening some people eating meals some people waiting eating cold vegetables left table while entrees being re done manager hovering trying apologize keep updated status missing meals. splurging limo transport group specifically place dinner total disappointment service really felt let down. food did look appetizing but just upset even eat once finally it. am sorry say probably won't back. 1st visit won't last. downtown touring mob museum stopped last minute only accommodated immediately but gave best seats house. Service excellent. Food consistently mouth watering! Steaks great chicken breast cooked perfection CRAB CAKES! Must do! Onion rings mac cheese WOW. delish. company town wanted impress them thought would best.... WRONG!!!!  5 orders Prime Rib order Sea Bass  order prawns crab... Nothing special.. prime Rib tough could hardly chew it.. When asked bag she actually brought plastic bag..... Ya think? wrap $45.00 dollar hunk RARE meat in.... Must say worst experience Las Vegas... Would recommend never return. somewhere else. service awful food. drinks always empty thirsty ask bus boy drinks since drunk server no where found kept forgetting. Paid way much disappointing meal. Outstanding selection steaks wines martinis. Great service. Also enjoyed host history Oscar view Fremont Experience. Great place birthday celebration hosted Math Graduate Assistants. buddy mood steakhouse old Vegas old school look feel Oscar's seemed fit bill.  both left bit disappointed.  service perfunctory throughout food good but great.  expected more money both ends.  might give place another try sometime but wouldn't way it. cannot emphasize impressive service food overall ambiance Oscar's Steakhouse.  second visit.  

On first visit only stayed bar enjoyed great bar appetizers.  Crab cakes steak tartare huge chilled shrimp.  All good had.

This next visit Thursday night seated great booth used movie Casino.  Great views Fremont street.

We shared fried Calamari Caesar salad huger bakes potato best pieces prime rib Las Vegas.  usually only eat prime rib lieu steaks eaten many steakhouses Vegas.

Our waiter Bobby professional!  couldn't asked someone better pamper us! wife made reservations well advance place reading other reviews here. Keep mind late Valentine's dinner date. 

Valet parking little bit confusing since pulled no valet guy...or girl...present. Since waiting causing little traffic small driveway just outside restaurant security guard told around again. When around again saw valet guy show he chillin' booth. WTH?! flag down tell we're eating restaurant. valet ticket he parking car front hotel.

We walked into hotel upstairs restaurant. hostess able sit immediately. when really south. assigned waiter table nowhere found 10 minutes looking menu. haven't even placed drink orders yet. wife wanted walk out. flag down another waiter taking care another table ask come weren't served yet. He least took over drink orders. He came back drinks told waiter assigned table no where found. Thumbs down! nice HANGRY told wife let's give place try. waiter flagged down volunteered waiter night.

Our volunteer waiter 'okay' since he take care additional table tables he assigned take care of. took little longer take care each table which understandable. 

As whiskey cocktail ordered orange juice taste good. forgot called. ordered glass Cabernet Sauvignon which good would expect be. food split rib eye shared side corn mashed potatoes. steak cooked way wanted it...medium. corn mashed potatoes cooked well dry. short food great compared lack waiter.

We didn't bother dessert. wife happy end night even though food great. She wanted fast paid cash did bother ask change. definitely coming back again even if messaged next visit would house. most disappointing experiences had. bar did any real upscale liquor serve could handle 3 drink two drinks wrong that included soft drink .

The service dinner atrocious. personnel notified 3 different times special occasion chose ignore it.

I several upscale restaurants Las Vegas live here. better attention chain restaurant less cost.

The food just so so nothing very special.

If think old school Vegas then need rethink idea. 2nd visit Oscar's. Service food both fantastic. Mac cheese truly lived its name...so creamy believe tasted smoked Gouda yummy!!! Steak cooked perfection crab cakes huge $16!! wife 10 14 celebrate 1st wedding anniversary while atmosphere service great food poisoning not! Let's just say both ended making several trips bathroom meal.... exactly wanted spend evening doing certainly price paid Best steak city beautiful dining room amazing view downtown Vegas. location downtown particular casino where restaurant located may bit deceiving but overall favorite where I'd take anyone looking impress great dinner. Outstanding everything absolutely perfect.  wife I's anniversary gave royal treatment best table house food incredible meat cooked perfect cuts fabulous.  service impeccable made night absolutely perfect.  honestly don't know restaurant negative reviews talking but couldn't Oscar's. COMPLETELY UNDERRATED AMAZING VALUE!
This mighty steakhouse excellent staff TREMENDOUS value!
Located Plaza yes Plaza which probably hurts stand steakhouse.
NOTE several absolute BEST steakhouses Las Vegas located horrible hotels.
VALUE A+ same steaks everyone else just bit less QUALITY solid wait staff very old school knowledgeable WINE B+ they everything but isnt place flying sommelier not really family place its slightly loud little bit crowded feeling but booth view downtown see your dollar stretch further without expense food service great time Larry amazing!  atmosphere festival.  food top notch.  Well u probably wondering why gave 1 star?  wait staff horrible!  wasn't given 1 refill soft drink 2 hours!  when came check she incompetent. Oh well. Maybe bad night her. But kinda ruined otherwise awesome night. Full disclosure late only drinks can't speak food...

Overall experience good prices weren't terrible staff very friendly.  when Firefly enjoyed view Fremont Street.

I'd love come back sometime try food. Wow! Wow! Wow! service! Food! view! great experince Oscar's! service amazing. Really well done. server Iggy perfect demeanor presentation. GM Perry checked in. Could asked more.2. food very good Crab starter well prepared done Maryland style nice large pieces creab compared more ususal patty style . chopped salad touted being unique special was. companion filet done oscar style prepared perfectly. Flatirn steak absolutely delicious. although bit spicy heat. perfect but understand others more sensitive . tried several good desserts chocolate mouse cake favorite! Food great hubby pork chops which everyone tables favorite! pork chops...service ok view Fremont st. nice sit right end Fremont people watch are. romantic restaurant great date night decor amazing well! husband stayed strip bought travelzoo voucher $99 $165 something deal. All all worth no. Definitely If you're staying strip...

Just getting uber bus back takes over hour your time. 

The restaurant itself huge hostess very professional never spoke just seated left. 

Our waitress did enjoy she several years very dry personality enjoyed thankfully see going different some people though.

We ordered crab cakes crab cakes best entire meal promise you. reason people rave numerous reviews. Never ever more fresh crab cake! bread next best thing entire meal including steaks. bread fresh onions baked into it. Very different very delicious. shocked didn't ask second loaf! serving helping everything very generous! 

Also dressed dress husbands wore khakis don't feel place most overdressed entire dining room. People wearing jeans baseball caps. entire dining room itself overlooks freemont street really no view bad view. 

My husband really enjoyed asparagus thought so. mac cheese definitely mediocre. filets weren't near tasty back Oklahoma. No seasoning seemed like.

When walked felt If wasted evening coming all way freemont deal. would rather spend extra $50 bucks better seasoned steak better quality food. Also would saved $30 ubers back. Just worth it. lot good food Las Vegas. pay small fortune eat table famous chef other end spectrum eat well modest price places Lotus Siam arguably best Thai restaurants country. find middle ground somewhat difficult navigate.

I found myself LV last night just night. husband told reservation Oscar's where he'd eaten couple times. He said I'd it. experience perfect moment walked through door. 

We seated window table overlooking Freemont Street. loved view. waiter walked over greeted name introduced himself. name Bobby. He may best waiter ever often eat  saying something. He offered recommendations explained preparation various dishes handled requests flawlessly. He funny charming dedicated. Since sharing several things he even sliced steak into strips set plate between could each take pieces without hassle cutting service kitchen charges $8 for. He told he just considers customer service if aren't slammed he does it.

We ate BREAD BUTTER something often mention but incredible! Hot soft flavorful onion delicious whipped butter. ate two baskets it! Well truthfully brought home. 
CORN CRAB BISQUE Absolutely delicious. crazy hot take care first bite. Also crab isn't nearly good lobster bisque.
SURF TURF Ribeye cooked perfection. barely needed knife cut it. Shrimp stuffed crab cakes served light flavorful sauce. ate more steak husband ate more shrimp. both very happy.
CORN BRULEE would eat every night! roast sweet corn cut off cob bake cream sauce parmesan. mouth watering just writing it.
MAC CHEESE Very good. Nothing unique but baked cast iron dish. Yummy.
BRUSSELS SPROUTS Also really good. raving sides because great but corn...

Start finish incredible time. food setting service all five star. If read review decide Oscar's ask Bobby. won't sorry. He really best waiter ever had. always looking best crab cakes Vegas. Every time new place serves crab cakes end ordering them most times disappointed. invited friends try Oscar's happy hour. ordered crab cakes of course meatballs fried calamari.
I fan calamari small mostly breading . meatballs flavorful just hoped served some kind bread dip sauce also served them barely warm which another minus. 
Now best part crab cakes finally say found best crab cake place town. 2 cakes even happy hour price big full crab meat almost no breading fillers just pure deliciousness!!!! would given place 5 stars if didn't order calamari meatballs. 
Our server very friendly too. 
Definitely going back. told stop dinner while downtown since best steaks we
were pleased meal view.
Oscars fun history view broad walks around visits your table very old Vegas which love.

The only thing negative say when bar only cocktail waitress failed let know ladies night women drank free. knew seeing website where made reservation night  surprised she did mentioned she did  happily gals sitting right next us. ALL LADIES..

 conclusion because guy just women she chose let know felt mistake part. upcharging behalf ? Im sure.

There really  should  no discrimination ladies night if Oscar's offer. enjoyed bar time some disappointment but entering dining room enjoying excellent service view took away prior event bar.

If your downtown check food wonderful dining room sweet..
Downtown really become project should saved its proof working hard so. Little known fact well least anyone Vegas place named Oscar Goodman once Mayor Vegas also mob lawyer. place HIGH END everything done EXCEPTIONALLY well cater royalty. MUST return spot next Vegas adventure sure!! Very nice location great view light show. 
Staff very helpful pleasant.  
All 4 steaks cooked perfectly portions filling.  
Crab cakes better calamari but steak tartar best appetizer.  
Excellent menu. apparently 15 minute rule.

I brought friends Los Angeles few times great experiences. Apparently under new management? sat waiters walked 10 minutes. flagged down he said he would right back watched help two more newer tables before he came back. still hour yet seen drinks. own water. AVOID place. hopeful great meal.  view great staff friendly.   food unfortunately very good.  send steak back because over cooked.  next time steak raw.  ended taking off bill.  friend pork chop half good.  other half under cooked.  returning. Gem Downtown Las Vegas! Perfect spot cocktail great dinner overlooking downtown. best reservations. recommend Nicky's Chicken Artichokes Joey C's Filet Mignon. Random dinner Monday night spouse dear friend Kate resulted stumbling Oscar's. mighty reluctant signage denoted beef beer broads. instantly thought some type sports bar. NOPE. high end steak house well worth visit.

Named former mayor Las Vegas Oscar Goodman Oscar's sits above hustle bustle Fremont Street Experience beautifully decorated. sat perfectly situated booth extremely comfy. walked table felt movie mafia drug lords. But great experience.

The prices more wanted spend but when food TOTALLY worth it. partner surf turf added piece blackened salmon it. delicious. don't mean lightly either. HATE steak despise BEST STEAK EVER HAD. surf turf came crab stuffed shrimp tomatoes grilled artichokes. delicious and hate artichokes .

We tried three sides mashed potatoes asparagus Mac n cheese. stands mention sides served family style shared between parties. enjoyed all sides ordered. asparagus cooked perfectly. still tasted fresh. mac n cheese delicious! Creamy plentiful. mashed potatoes equally good.

The service impeccable. very happy attention expertise server Lorene. She incredibly professional yet personable friendly. Very attentive needs. 

When bill proud pay cause value experience incredible.

Treat yourself Oscar's. MEAN beautifully cooked rib eye few fun spicy cocktails. Actually whole meal more enjoyable exciting your standard run mill $$$ steakhouse. place worth walk over plaza. service also made night! Awesome restaurant...the food great! service above beyond Joyce awesome person overall. Justin aka Mgr even more attentive. see again. OSCAR'S neat happy hour view interesting combo street people towners.  Would special trip Oscar's no! But if stuck staying downtown probably best safest option. attended four course Thanksgiving dinner.

First course bland salad.

Nothing special salad dressing except some crushed walnuts surprisingly well lettuce.

Second course bland pumpkin soup.

It terrible actually. Imagine pumpkin pie without sugar cinnamon. just thick orange slop.

Third course turkey dinner!

If betting man would say processed turkey made actual turkey looking thing ate Thanksgiving.

The plate served cranberry sauce stuffing baby onions mashed sweet potatoes tiny zucchinis. no idea thinking onions sweet potatoes.

Last course desert!

I took apple streusel go. okay.

For $55 expected better tasting food.

The staff professional very attentive.

I'm sure I'd back another meal. If didn't know already restaurant opened former mayor Las Vegas Oscar Goodman hence name Oscar's. 

Located 2nd floor Plaza hotel faces beginning fremont street experience. Upon entry MAIN ENTRANCE restaurant not back elevator whatever photos some famous people dined restaurant including current sigh... former 3 presidents well some others Celine Dion etc.

The restaurant huge dome design glass panels view barely hindered anything. restaurant really brightly lit natural lighting during day looks whole lot better inside does outside. 

Service really fast soon seated. water cup never below 50% empty. waiter Bobby fairly attentive during visit. little confusing part when ordering but clarified pretty easily. Bobby even apologized even though entirely fault. asked bone specials directed menu friend also birthday boy change decision REAL FAST ! lol he originally dead set getting bone rib eye. second waiter mentioned special 42 oz tomahawk steak saw eyes smile widen !! friend opt'ed tomahawk lobster tail combo. dont remember prices exactly but tomahawk itself $90s. dont remember much combo. 

I opted bone rib eye steak $64 . saw offered special not really any 3 sides $22. Why said really because printed menu. its really special per se.. But still saves money if intend 3 sides. sides average $7 9 dollars each  if all $9 ones saves u 5 bucks. Other things ordered party Spicy Flame Charred Spoilotro Steak  Sally's New York Strip Prime Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake recommendation couple leaving restaurant while waiting Jasper Hunchy's Tomato Salad some sides. 

SIDE NOTE apparently give different knives. larger knife males smaller knife females... LOL REFER PICTURE ! 

Tomahawk Steak w Lobster Tail honest didnt look 42 oz when came out. Probably more 30s. Bone little shorter seen tomahawks. steak ordered medium. center borderline rare. Cool red center. birthday boy loved though. He no complaints !

Oscar's Bone In Ribeye $64 sure size steak but id probably say around 16oz so. Ordered medium rare came towards medium center. exterior steak really nice char it. cap really tender. Overall seasoning really good. Wished slightly less cooked ordered eye portion though

Spicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak $29 well seasoned skirt steak described ! Infused garlic red chili fakes ! kick actually much more expected steakhouse. friend love eating spice both quite surprised. Seasoned well. Well made skirt steak ! 

Johnny Quinn's Crab Cake $19 recommended passing couple just finished dinner leavin restaurant standing front. highly recommended crab cake crab ball best they've ever had. weren't kidding. Two large balls crab cake arrived some stone ground mustard pepper remoulade. crab very tender sweet. overpowered any veggies seasoning some others may do. crab definitely star ! ground mustard subtle overpowering some may be. Paired well crab. Preferred mustard over pepper remoulade. 

Jasper Hunchy's Tomato Salad seasonal red yellow orange tomatoes burrata cheese EVOO micro greens. drizzled balsamic reduction top . YUMMY ! apparently burrata combination mozzarella outside 2 other cheeses middle creating soft interior normal mozzarella outside. very clean simple but delicious dish ! 

As sides Jose Leonardo Roasted Corn Brulee  Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac Cheese  Steak Fries . roasted corn best 3. Fresh chewy corn mushy. bit saddened lack brulee part. hoping crack through something when first dug into side dish. mac cheese most underwhelming. Using gemelli pasta yeah rich creamy pasta but nothing special. steak fries fried well soft fluffy interior. I'd probably prefer fries over mac. 

Overall good experience ! Good place try downtown ! food great! Blackened Salmon delicious very moist.
I also Alpine Village soup am local soup good but didn't think taste Alpine Village love Broads old Vegas look very nice touch well live piano !! Defiantly recommend Food great. service lacking. First manager clear plates silverware before even food. asked bread plates silverware back did bring them. ask other things did bring them. waiter Bobby great but some other staff need more training. before much better service. Maybe Oscar's need more training staff. Marilyn Bobby did wonderful job. Even manager staff need more training.  prices pay everything should perfect. give half star?????

This quite shocking actually especially big name restaurant bar Vegas.

 First Issue seated ourselves bar....no approached manager did walk past 12 min husband asked hostess if cocktail service? She responded yes pointed girl talking friends bar....we did finally drinks delivered manager walked past 20 min earlier.. No napkins NO olives Martini 
     table behind having similar service issues until someone running Judge joined them then service golden except NO cocktail napkins WTF? Even dive bars middle nowhere give u napkin under ur Beer  
   server needs training lots it! Tosha recognized displeasure did comp drinks. Which nice however took business D enjoyed cocktails NAPKINS OLIVES APPETIZERS BEST SERVICE EVER ALI bartender @ Adiamo's! Having met man twice finding quite entertaining character decided try restaurant inspired him. Oscar Goodman. formerly happiest mayor earth. former mob defense attorney. He image quintessential Vegas. try steakhouse. 

Entering coworker 8 pm Monday night seated right away. Service only described short surly. hostess two servers encountered consistently strong impression looking watches anticipation closing time. stark contrast say Vic Anthony's Steakhouse over Golden Nugget see separate review . 

The menu mob inspired consisting names gangsters you'll recognize. Spilatro's Steak garlic mashed potatoes. may look much attached photo bit actually quite good. 

The restaurant adorned photos Oscar career. think theme works fine location great. area formerly occupied Firefly directly West end Fremont Street. dining area over looks Fremont Street Experience. excellent view. 

All all food good. theme fun. But service much. always deeply disappointed when place gets much right then just drops all customer service. other places Vic's right consistently places don't? think starts top. Carefully screening right personalities hire then training evaluating them. Consistently. 

Oscar's needs attempt here. until servers bring down house. may why much open seating 8 pm during Spring Break week. 

I sincerely hope bring around because I'd see place survive. If enough people point them maybe will. Came Wednesday locals night where all happy hour all night long instead 4 7. half off bottles wine champagne. Probably hands down best happy hours city. Between dinner menu happy hour menu really can't wrong. beef carpaccio could eat all day. meatballs delicious ! dinner prime rib steaks stuffed shrimp.. all favorites mine. Good music great vibe! Cody GM he awesome checking us! Good service but family 8 spent 5+ hrs gambling thousands dollars table room front entrance approached personal concierge ashley took all names info told now reservation restaurant meal would completely paid for... only bill server $800 dollars told only $100 covered... talking manager explaining told sorry totally understand but happens lot then shortly surrounded security forced pay tab. reward spending crazy amount money casino being conned into eating crazy expensive steak house spending another $800 Wonderful great music food service definitely back! only thing really bothered practice adding 30% gratuity without telling you. left 40% tip loved service . When bill line pretty upset added extra money bill. When called them told would straightened couple days. celebrated birthday second time. absolutely love food here. started off delicious crab cake then bone in ribeye creamed spinach smashed potatoes asparagus. also brought birthday cheesecake. Everything ordered cooked perfectly. server Tasha friendly genuine care guests. seriously favorite restaurant downtown. food delicious. filet Oscar style perfect!  party four all enjoyed dinner. hostess needs attitude adjustment. She seemed annoyed having walk table just wasn't pleasant all. good. best steaks ever had. Bone filet amazing. Carpaccio also really good. worst steaks ever had. both Filet just bad cut wasn't cooked correctly both very dry burnt taste them. potato's nothing special crab cakes nothing special. place nothing Ruth Chris. Then leave walk through casino Plaza butt hole downtown Las Vegas smelled ass.  name dozen better steak houses Vegas blow place away. really thought Oscar Goodman higher standards then this. view cool staff ok. Waiting 45 minutes seated wasn't. Steve BEST bartender! Always great service he also recommendations drinks if you're quite sure want either. Food fantastic recommend meatballs calamari appetizer stuffed jumbo shrimp delicious! Oscars place downtown nice dinner out. husband's birthday dinner apart fact only black people entire restaurant great time. food prepared order waiter I can't recall name but he amazing. He welcoming told little story himself brief history restaurant. He made feel comfortable all smiles laughter.  place highly recommeded glad there. amazing view enjoyed dinner. husband happy he favorite meal steak dinner. Lol. Overall great experience amazing waiter! prime rib butter cut through. smaller cut enough 2 people. Ordered three sides corn brûlée such gratin potatoes Mac cheese. All awesomely buttery creamy. corn brûlée seemed little under cooked. creamy horseradish absolutely perfect spicy. drink menu left something desired while full bar could use some updated interesting drinks those under 65. Service fast friendly. broad walks around interacts tables. She very nice educated restaurant owner. slightly awkward interaction though. Hmmmm lot Orangehead glowing reviews. Seems bit suspicious me.

I Oscar's earlier week did phenomenal experience some alleged Yelp rookies. fan old school Vegas very excited when Vegas native recommended me. Beef Booze Broads sounds something Dean Sammy Frank would frequent excited. Overall Oscar's left grouchy despite fantastic view Sesame mean Fremont St.

First off let's location way. wall windows provides exciting romantic atmosphere depending your purpose. Unfortunately half empty dining room weeknight does inspire staff seat unless decide pony companionship broad let's discuss elephant room. broads roam room looking spark conversations customers. OK am cool that. You're supposed buy them drink. Uhhh OK! then dinner....and then tip them? acquaintance bought into ploy although fairness girl did push hard . glasses wine entree tacked $50 bill then tip. celebrating afraid drop some cash but seems restaurant should done better job explaining concept. reunion buds continually interrupted broads.

The service slow but engaging. several put off fact cuts meat choice but charged prime prices. consensus OK but worthy price. sides uninspiring. 

Oscar's new maybe improve. Also being Dallas steakhouses nobody's business perhaps standards high. cheaper prices Nick Sam's Pappas' steak put Oscar's shame some adult mac n' cheese lobster swoon. enjoy Oscar's view beware. Feel free chat broad but know getting into. love Oscar's love food love drinks. little pricier should big staff. Some them bit arrogant. actually servers butt into conversation having wife correct he thought talking about.  kind thing bar area great usually nice lounge performer.  nice old Vegas feel occasional buzz kill entitled server staff. Oscar's great find downtown Vegas! am giving establishment 4 stars because waitstaff somewhat flustered loud short beginning evening due computer system being down. could handled situation better but did redeem themselves bit later evening. However would give food atmosphere 5 stars. Everything delicious.The dining room gorgeous night. located glass domed room 3 chandeliers center circular room.  meatball appetizer entrees Spilotro Steak Sea Bass entrees side dishes augratin potatos bacon brussel sprouts macaroni cheese asparagus every bite enjoyable reasonably priced. recommend if you're looking delicious food willing travel away strip nice reasonably priced dinner. Came past weekend husband's 40th bday awesome. filet blue cheese phenomenal. tender blue cheese point they didn't skimp either. waitress great didn't name but she friendly funny split bill into multiple credit cards since 7 people group she more accommodating. sides decent but steak star show. view great inside really cool windows view downtown. If love steak def recommend Oscars prices cheaper lot steak houses strip. Yes. food fucking phenomenal. But let tell Bobby. If waiting table Jabba Hutt Bobby Princess Leia. If prices Reavers Bobby Mal. If fancy shmancy Dalek Bobby Doctor. 
In other words... abilities show truly are.  choices. Dumbledore And Bobby exemplifies mother fucker. Disclaimer am drunk write but sober stand behind claims Bobby Server Extraordinaire. If Yubaba shitty service Bobby Jahiro. 
#Bobbyisthesecondcoming Overpriced thing. Overpriced average another. bone in ribeye $64. Sides extra. Don't mind paying but expect excellence. Oscars did deliver. Many gourmet restaurants Las Vegas better choices if looking splurge meal. Excellent! every aspect.  service setting food.  made reservations dine show Smiths Center although arrived  15 minutes later reservation hostess seated server guys bar all very hospitable welcoming.   didn't even clue closed when arrived.  Only when asked hours when server told closed 10pm right when arrived.  He said worry he already let chef know he seated another party also came show.
   
After hearing specials evening decided Surf Turf...Lobster Filet Mignon. totally forgot find cost sorry! know prices entrees menu line other steakhouses area. bill came under 15o bucks pretty much average 2 steak sides desserts drinks.   

Now steak! High quality grass fed. Light char  when sliced butta flavorful! Ordering med rare way go.  No wonder #5 top steakhouses strip.  told Mr. B. steak far tops other steakhouse dined last month. lobster..was good sized portion too. super hungry meal good because cleaned plate. and those know know  very rare! The ambiance throwback feel old Vegas era. servers pin striped vest white ties ala mob inspired. restaurant located dome area revamped Plaza Hotel open airy feel it. Colors white silver trio huge crystal chandeliers gives touch elegance. sets tone dressy casual wear.  I'd leave shorts tanks your hotel room but vibe casual friendly enough where wont feel outcast if under dressed.  added bonus restaurant views your table booth. catch Fremont Street Experience light show restaurant.
  
Service mentioned excellent. server Ray pretty easy going.  fact server table across all conversing Burt Bacharach show saw. told making point sure seated area next time book reservation.  runners kept table cleaned crumbed table kept drinks filled. Oscar's Broad Vanna made rounds came table showgirl outfit.

For sake someone looking review wondering Oscar...It's your Hizzoner! Former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman yes restaurant.  ..and yes where filmed some scenes move Casino where he played himself mob lawyer! ..it's why wanted dine but real happy did. back again since  seeing alot shows over Smiths Center. Dinner OK friend Chef he felt Bisque much Roux it. steak pretty good but little dry considering 50 bucks. friends Prime looked cut spoon shape doorstop needs learn properly cut prime rib sure. 

Go Delmonico steakhouses cosmopolitan you'll much happier if steak your looking for.

Oh yeah didn't even Rib eye cut other Prime Rib....this odd.

I would say less expensive items menu would salmon known steak would only soso.

They really friendly restaurant very nice outstanding view down Fremont street.. say rarely write review restaurant but felt Oscars deserved credit. far best restaurants Las Vegas. service excellent food phenomenal. also  nice because halfway through meal Oscar wife showed dinner also. saw we're very nice welcoming all onlookers rude it. definitely come again recommend restaurant anyone. only drinks but great experience. drink prices terrible staff very friendly atmosphere relaxing. Definitely visit next time downtown Las Vegas. brought group here. ok steak potato everything delicious. 
A little pricey ok service Show girls ok real friendly. best dining experience long long time.
The food awesome seasoned cooked perfection.
More flavor filled twice price.
Especially recommend prime rib crab cakes which good didn't even need sauce.
Our esteemed former mayor real winning team assembled here.
Everyone chef servers best.
Thanks Oscar's go to restaurant whenever Smiths Center never disappointed tonight no exception! sure ask Bobby he server multiple occasions always takes great care along providing comic relief sharing stories growing Las Vegas. Amazing service amazing food amazing wine amazing ambiance amazing Bobby!!! Nice place old strip Las Vegas.  Loved service food view. little history lesson boot best part place huge servings Impersonator Robert De Niro price sides high but compared other restaurants area. don't really care la carte menus. roasted chicken super tasty. friend 25 oz bone in rib eye he ate all way bone. 

I whiskey cocktail quite strong took whole meal finish it! aware if you're big drinker.  

There Jazz singer lounge able hear dinning room cool! Great food atmosphere easier Dino business over 30 years! He made evening really special celebrating 29th anniversary! local friend chose spot dinner.  7 gathered all tried different dishes all very happy choices.  mac'n'cheese creamed spinach amazing very large easily split between multiple people.  crab stuffed shrimp delicious.  all Vegas restaurants wine priced extremely high but selection vast enough find vintage could enjoy.  
Loved all photos hallway Oscar celebs through area. took girl friend bd while back having heard good things. Great atmosphere ambience wasn't overcrowded excellent service personable waiter hostess stopped check us. view Fremont experience awesome restaurant well insulated noise next door. rub couldn't past quality food didn't correspond quality rest experience. filet mignon which $50+ bit into gristle fatty chunk it. What??  whole point filet can't head around  even possible. sub par being kind leaving that. gf T bone which also left lot desired. Having moved recently Chicago really missing places Gibson's Morton's which cost less far better. honestly resentful paying almost $250 bill 3 people feel paid surcharge being Vegas place some history story behind it. Needless say  first last trip Oscar's. Work getting food match view decent steakhouse. ate Oscar's watching restaurant featured Anthony Bourdain. celebrated birthday loved it!! Bobby waiter phenomenal knowledge Las Vegas attentiveness amazing.  crab stuffed Shrimp which delicious boyfriend filet Mignon which mouth watering.  cheesecake which Happy Birthday written icing cake. awesome birthday dinner!! We'll definitely eat again next time Las Vegas!! Very good food ambiance.  

I think Mayor Goodman sucked all charisma sommelier because she more dry New Zealand Savignon Blanc.  

The service outstanding personable.  Very much would expect Oscar himself.  Try Crazy Phil's Onion Soup start definitely save room dessert.  

High marks latkes schnitzel table.  early view Fremont Street experience ask table view when your reservation.  Certainly worthwhile.  Enjoy. Update further reflection consideration am keeping original review below but changing overall star rating reflect overall restaurant experience. feel valet shuttle BS Plaza Oscars would definitely recommend restaurant. Read below original review Beware free shuttle Smith Center fine print. Et tu Oscar?!?

Food 4 5
Service 4 5
Experience 4.5 5

Full disclosure restaurant experience great. review first.

We seated main dining area. airy bright but old school feel steak house. circular dining room unique window ceiling cool. really enjoyed early evening meal under Vegas lights.

I bone in filet wife 8 oz filet. Cooked order tasted seared under salamander nice salt pepper crust intrusive. Bone good value $55. Service par standard nice restaurant. Prompt water refills staff cognizant need show time which end evening confusing.

One reasons attracted Oscars besides reputation restaurant free shuttle Smiths Center. no problem valet shuttle driver but surprise when returned found $15 charge pick car.

I hate posting reviews where something sours experience but felt such bait switch couldn't help deduction. ironic part if known $15 valet ahead time wouldn't upset. Instead felt cheated. number options Vegas most places looking nickel dime sure there's better option. Try Golden Steer Top Binions never felt cheated either.

Perhaps if more upfront policy realize nice dinner show takes more four hours may return but until then let review serve warning potential theater goers. Learn mistake. If rib eye fan willing spend little more usual place disappoint!  surprised rib eye menu but waiter mentioned specials.  should asked much but didnt matter.  Every bit 32 + oz steak worth it!  Service outstanding wall dedicated pictures cartoons Oscar Goodman quite colorful figure!  great time highly recommend! Fremont Street really become armpit Las Vegas despite artistic effort resurrect it.  view OK given look over bunch kiosks half naked girls pushing slushie drinks frankly look little trashy.  all sitting upscale restaurant owned previous mayor Las Vegas?  Confusing yes.
The bar nice roomy however dining room jammed little.  Menu Cute named Mobsters its step away culinary standards.  think ONLY McDonalds silly names food. little trendy silly serious restaurant.  Did say serious.
I ordered fish tasted very ammonia old even 8 lemons going help this.
My date ordered steak which wasn't anything special but most certainly beef.

Creme Brule better buffet.

This serious restaurant know if here.

However off own website addition great food Oscar's Beef * Booze * Broads pairs great meal unique opportunity Oscar's Broads visit customers during dinner. attractive women dinner companions discuss subjects such politics sports wine Las Vegas history things downtown Strip. When dining customers roam Downtown Las Vegas restaurant hostesses adding glamorous uniquely Vegas style Oscar's Women Broads when saw form borders looks some weak form prostitution don't even think restaurant should allowed operate.


If lure patrons into your restaurant women food your zero!  Cannot recommend place. Watching casino made want eat fan Oscar! took girlfriend birthday she loved it! Steaks good wine good love ambience! regular 5stars!!! Love place! #Bruce Nachelle!!! Disappointed.

My husband Vegas few weekends ago decided step Hugo's Cellar routine try Oscars.  heard good things Yelp good reviews gave shot.

I ordered pepper garlic infused steak waitress explained rough cut meat becomes very tender due time marinated.  While flavor good meat TOUGH.  ate 20% steak rest waste.  husband pretty much eat anything said steak awful.

My husband said order steak good but needed additional salt.

Our sides potatoes asparagus.  potatoes... OMG GOOD!  asparagus awful... woody oversized tough.

For amount paid pretty disappointed time walked there.  waitress slammed busy didn't really allow time bring concerns left... ended needing order fries hot dog place D later night. Most disappointing all... called next day let manager know disappointment steak asparagus fact paid all money stuff waste.  told wasn't available but left name number.  still no returned call. recent renovation put fresh modern face nearly iconic domed dining space Plaza. overlooking Fremont Street fabulous downtown Las Vegas. Take escalator 2nd floor see Oscar's Beef Booze Broads steakhouse.

Service friendly informed efficient. Food quite wonderful. Being locals delighted see Las Vegas legend menu ... Alpine Village's Chicken Noodle Soup. your typical chicken noodle soup but savory satisfying!  Now recall Alpine Village restaurant but never enjoyed chicken noodle soup am sure Oscars' version compares. hope Yelper first hand knowledge share soupinion .

We window table close center dome fun entertaining view people parade Fremont street below. 

Our entrées Halibut Special Bone In Prime Rib fabulous! Halibut perfectly cooked prime rib ginormous medium well still tender. Oscar's horsey sauce top notch well perfectly balanced taste. ordered creamed spinach mac cheese sides. Both good albeit slightly under seasoned but adding little salt pepper easy fix.

Splurging dessert chose Creme Brulee he Tiramisu both made in house . actually thought full dinner but somehow magical creme brulee vanished mysteriously into mouth within seconds. crazy good!  tiramisu yummy but CB still mouth water.

Not crazy broads aspect ... Nice enough ladies but whole bit felt kind being visited annoying mariachi band tits. am sure would want wander room full strangers wearing evening dress puppy begging attention making small talk then expecting strangers pay privilege. Awkwaaaard! 

Overall fun enjoyable dining experience bar appeared hoppin' well. also thought cool smoking lounge outside restaurant cocktail lounge nice touch appreciated thoroughly enjoyed. Took parents first time them Vegas.  Loved it.  Good value great food amazing waitress Tasha! Thank experience parents loved it.  All prime rib sides asparagus Brussel sprouts smashed potatoes! Unfortunately wife's birthday!! thought could treat nice dinner. wrong. Food good but service...  first off even though sat 9 30pm still rushed order literally even though obviously studying cocktail menu food order asked first. steak served birthday wife dying nice glass red wine match steak took way long server check back! Why said unfortunately wife's birthday key!! server nice enough treat dessert birthday but when asked desserts she said going slice cheesecake asked see dessert menu she responded can't afford any other dessert her! Firstly if she's actually paying secondly all desserts 7$!!  before chance order dessert put cheesecake front her! would rather paid $7 give she wants birthday! already paying  $60 steak! now when comes birthday dessert settle mind rather spending $7 give birthday girl she wants?!?!? But  even end story! ordered glass ice wine$25! But once again how dare choose own  $7 dessert inniskillin where grew up. though would good pairing stupid cheesecake forced upon her. where gets crazy!!!! both swear wine watered down!! know   big accusation but viscosity water i grew where know! could just taste watered down flavor it. assuming last bottle added water level glass acceptable! Poor birthday girl!!! why??? Great experience. waiter pleasure talk to. Great soul patch way pretty awesome. He discussed different pronunciations tiramisu based where live Italy. manager Monty incredibly accommodating escorted area where could enjoy some fabulous coffee cigarette meal. red pepper roumelade crab cakes amazing. Bone ribeye fabulous. new puppy border collie Higgs enjoy bone solid 4 hours which wrapped passed out. imagine marrow incredible delicious perfectly medium rare was. He spoiled. local nice good relaxing meal dad birthday. Great experience great food. Highly recommend locals. should consider local discount advertise would bring ton more business especially weekday nights. Carolyn's cut Prime Rib.  monster smaller cut .  Cooked perfection.  Also side brussels sprouts caramelized onions bacon.  Add glass Pinot Noir perfect.  Ate bar service fantastic.  pay little more but meal. hubby wandering around Fremont st thinking where eat. try list while. decided stop in. Even though dinner time weekend didn't wait. 

They seated dining room facing main st. say Slotzilla monstrosity eyesore great view steakhouse. Even worse restaurant worst view eyesore the back it. Ughhh. know restaurants fault no stars deducted note. 

The service decent throughout night. server attentive brought food followed up. couple ladies the broads? Lol Oscars customary showgirls walking around talking diners. asked if we're local know why called oscars know Oscar etc. Im huge fan being bothered while eating out. But maybe tourists kick history tidbits. 

The food pretty good 5 star quality but good nonetheless. serve complimentary onion bread starters. bone ribeye $68 husband pork chops. Both tasty but ribeye cost rivals strip competitors offering higher quality steak comparable prices. would rather delmonicos same price. price pork chops reasonable given quality though. sides served shareable portions la carte opted super healthy options au gratin mac cheese. Both good but next time we'll share it. 

Overall steakhouse decent option Fremont street. But best town. wouldn't avoid but wouldn't way eat either.  If back try something else easier wallet see if worth the bone ribeye most expensive cut meat menu . am business conference decided try restaurant.  business since 1939 elegant vintage feel upscale way.  service excellent.  food phenomenal.  highly recommend restaurant! Excellent service food always.
Crab cake onion soup barside. Same bartenders every year.
I stay twice year never disappointed food service outstanding!

Happy hour even better deal through week if early bird.

The bar quite nice inviting. also pub tables sit love seat coffee table style seating. chose love seats.  met another couple best time. service ok but server bar busy server blame. Another slight negative loud. yell across coffee table hear each other.
Three ordered house cab ordered house chardonnay start off with.  chardonnay ok but just brushed teeth maybe affected taste.  then switched house Cabernet great.  stuck rest evening did everyone else group. ordered 2 rounds calamari.  light home style breading flecked black pepper served 2 sauces creamy lemon aioli marinara.  sauces good but could used bigger portion them.  calamari little inconsistent first plate second.  first plate seasoned well second plate under seasoned. 
Overall fabulous time return maybe try fabulous views Fremont Street dinning room. Fast service pretty nice atmosphere. liked poke appetizer crab cake only ok. Check you'll free glass wine! Perfect  

Our waitress waitress very friendly only thing wished should keep filling at least my water... SO.Thirsty long chat. Mixed.  place owned former mayor Las Vegas Oscar Goodman.  He became mayor serving defense attorney mob 30 years Las Vegas.  Thus lot history place.  

Pros New York Steak outstanding.  Perfectly cooked insides cooked right temperature.  salmon good well.  seasoned potato wedges good accompaniment steak.  Creme Brulee Chocolate Lava Cake outstanding.  Extensive wine lists moderate expensive wines.  Also ambience great.  piano man playing background showgirls walking around floor talking patrons walls photos Oscar Goodman politicos celebrities etc... great.  

Cons Open since Dec 11. Still growing pains. wife ordered onions seafood did come meal.  waiter reminded finally arrived she finished meal.  taken away apology waiter.  should more consideration considering costs paid meal.  Beer all bottled none tap.  

So if steak place.  Depending he time day expect long wait.  surprised if meal wrong.  But when steak arrives should very pleased.  two people main course 1 soup two side dish accompaniments two desserts soda cocktail expect drop $130 plus.  Bottle wine would added $50.00 total minimum. best food since Vegas! bartender amazing sidecar made lime juice instead lemon steak excellent.. Friendly staff.. Don't walk RUN place view can't beat!  food delicious but sadly other reviewers service lacking.  $100+ per person should NEVER ask refills water wine cocktails.  would imagine any resort first questions server would ask would where brought property.  case.  Thank goodness neglect server over shadowed food.  

The food runners other hand quick knowledgeable running cute butts off!

Oscars need train your servers pay attention fact work 3 star steakhouse Las Vegas.  give service less attentive then Outback down street me.  I'd love return those crab cakes prime rib Mac cheese but take business back down Freemont Vic Anthony's. Old School ... 

While food good really ambiance view which return.  

It feels time gone by. Beautiful women lovely gown stroll around help create ambiance 1930's 1940's 

It seems Al Capone could stroll Frank Sinatra Duke Ellington would leading live band other room. 

So order whatever want... all good spectacular but very nice food. enjoy very different experience view Fremont street zip liners. peaceful enjoyable place ! Waiter Jenifer nice person! She very friendly ! music melodic.   spent good time family! restaurant really nice. also lounge front restaurant. service outstanding! chicken juicy full flavor. definitely back try steak. Although seems very intimate setting three year old son welcomed First time good great though.  Caesar salad filet mignon baked potato. Excellent service very cheerful helpful. Caesar didn't really taste caesar bland romain very fresh though. Filet cooked perfect lots flavor. probably stick Vic Anthonys when Vegas. Scott great server good attention detail personable.  Food high quality pricing line. Great experience!
Food could warmer. Evidently cook doesn't feel way.  Still great experience  we'll worth cost back again! Food incredible.  Steak best years.  View spectacular.  Service needed some work.  waiter flustered entire evening. Worst dinning experience while. husband enjoy fine dinning Las Vegas but restaurant truly horrible.

We place Saturday show Smith Center. ordered Halibut dish husband ordered Ahi Tuna along 3 side dishes Cream spinach mashed potato onion strings . friends ordered calamari appetizer prime rib shrimp salad main dishes. 10 minutes order waiter informed no more Ahi tuna nor Halibut day. only seafood served Tilapia per waiter supposedly sublime.

The Tilapia turned super greasy overcooked. friend's $61 prime rib over cooked well. All side dishes tolerable but definitely very greasy. also wine which memorable.

When bill came surprised charged each additional  $10 Oscar's top which did order. Per waiter creamy sauce placed top Tilapia dish which did tell first place. Since no Tilapia menu waiter charge $38 Tilapia dish charged husband $41 his. no idea why pricing different although identical dishes. Upon questioning waiter mumbled something since don't argue high end restaurant just paid left.

I would given restaurant 1 star husband gotten sick food following day. husband nausea sensation following 24 hours some diarrhea. also mild nausea but symptoms more mild. Overall $80 per person meal think many other places Beautiful restaurant pretty interesting story behind its creation. Thank Mayor Oscar Goodman. 

We arrived early enjoy drink bar first. Soo. sat beautiful round table right center restaurant. view gorgeous open roof windows all around site downtown Fremont nice way enjoy evening. 

Crab cake meatball appetizers tasty generous portion enough share amongst 10 us. Shrimp served shrimp cocktail huge!
I sea bass shockingly surprised size fish. Definitely recomend seabass if prefer seafood dinner. Again generous portion. Unfortunately bone filet disappointment very dry little flavor. Desserts nice way end evening. cheesecake soft moist creme brulee delicious. tiramisu other hand good but presentation horrible. looked slop just plopped down plate. 

Service par. server didn't smile once looked few times order another drink main entrees arrived 25 minutes appetizers cleared table. 

Not crossing place off possible return however... Zipped happy hour well drinks Friday. Nice bar area uber friendly bartenders. Nice view Fremont Street. Excellent cocktails $4.50 each. good happy hour Crab cakes looked good. Next time... Beef booze Bobby!! He Nick best steak top notch drinks fab! #oscars filet potatoes corn crab soup nick side bobby entree loved it!! Classy spot! lounge singer bar really set great tone waited seated. Very impressive view looking down Fremont Street.

I ordered butterfly cut filet mignon medium well. might best steaks ever had! tender much flavor. Definitely recommend dinner. Absolutely nothing wrong food actually expensive thought would be. don't tell *everyone* but $29 'Spilotro' steak enough 2 persons incredibly delicious generous portion skirt steak stuffed whole garlic cloves ! comes portion mashed potatoes too. 

Pretty awesome jumbo lump Crab Cakes two big ones $17 waiter actually declared 'money back guarantee' if didn't them. didn't take because good crab cakes get.

The environment very vintage Vegas you'd imagine mid century modernesque atrium where every seat commanding view Fremont Street Experience. Sunday night when restaurant sans signature 'broads' which fine me. can't imagine kitschy team flirty girls would average diners' meal any better already is.

Quite underrated establishment if ask me. enjoyed *way* more Golden Steer Steak House Circus Circus... others said Oscar's great place soak some old school Vegas.   Prepare transformed swanky decor classy dining atmosphere.  jazzy style pianist singer thick white table clothes well dressed servers.  even lady old school performer costume walking around asking people doing.

The view great main dining area absolutely loved circular window looking over Fremont Street.  service great food good too.  wish price would more La Carte but seemed normal practice majority nice restaurants dined while visiting Las Vegas.  

I 22oz rib eye mashed potatoes Old Fashioned.  $65 steak wanted cut meat flavor marbling all good stuff  blow away much presentation....
Presentation 10
Flavor 7.5

Either way great meal even better experience.  Thanks cab driver suggesting it. wanting try steak house since opened travel Vegas frequently play poker. Every trip town special events town always love good steak...I hoped 5 star time...but settled 3. ambiance bar area aims old school Vegas speakeasy vibe it...and hits mark...I could picture place being back day...although lights would bit bright Mr Sinatra's taste would guess I sat bar interaction bartender minimal...did job nothing bad great set apart. ordered Steak Au Poivre...the ny strip cooked order...and quality wise...ok...average price. did stand Au Poivre sauce almost more BBQ peppery. Maybe chef didn't stir pepper settled bottom before he ladelled it...I don't know. didn't ruin meal but could been. Potato Croquettes other hand perfectly done. recommend your side any meal place.
What finished off experience floor manager. she came asked meal was. commented positives then told Au Poivre sauce...to which reply Oh food critic? Perhaps aim condescending...I would hope  case...but immeadiate thought Isn't every customer yours evaluating meal? ...and someone run front house restaurants 20 years...that wrong way interact guest.
So...overall...an ok steak house...but left bad taste mouth...whether sauce manager quite sure. dinner  7 18.
Drinks Not great.My gf ordered cranberry Kettle One.Didnt taste cranberry juice server said cranberry cocktail ok no biggie.Ordered mojito many mint leaves she could drink almost whole plant glass all  tasted mint.
Appetizers Fried calamari excellent.Cold seafood platter oysters mussels crab leg lobster tail ok seemed sitting few hours could fresher mussel shells crushed didnt eat it.Bread excellent.
Salad Chopped salad good.
Entrees.Prime rib dried out.Swordfish special ended being something frozen
on bed mushy overcooked bland risotto.Fish overcooked.No seasoning no taste.Sent back.I would think being special would fresh should asked mistake.Still if werent overcooked under seasoned might ok.
Service ok greeted very lovely ladies escorted table then waited. waited ..... waited. When server finally appeared he friendly enough yet unprepared us. No bread no water no smiles ..  room unbearably hot point which could see sweat coming through shirts wait staff. But bread cold ask 20 minutes still no water drinks. no manager duty he never know where find direct quote servers! .

The food under done mooing strip steak overdone shoe leather and still good luck finding manager . Bland side dishes having ask water several times dirty dishes remaining table more ten minutes a couple times . 

Vegas Baby!!  all food Recommendation's somewhere else husband ate last Monday night. almost didn't because poor reviews. 

The food excellent.From Antipasto right thru main course Expresso instead desert because full.

Service excellent too. But hard bad service when only poeple restaurant. 

We visit Las Vegas once year NCAA tournament time. We'll back next year. Hands down best steaks ever. cuts HUGE! 3 all split 2 steaks some sides. bone ribeye prime rib. Sides onion strings Brussels mac cheese. That Mac cheese legit. grown Mac cheese lol Nicks service excellent. He told all specials checked promptly attentive but annoying way waiters be. He gave brief history lesson restaurant hotel He also recommendations city. 

The restaurant over looks Fremont street request window possible! 


I highly recommend!

Hot tip food cards strip. tix tonight near M M store. $5 person 30% off meal all parties. Saved $40! tremendous restaurant very fun place downtown Las Vegas.  Ask Nick your server great client accommodation. Best Happy Hour Downtown. place time capsule mention where shot parts Casino. wanna feel made man? Come happy hour order martini fried calamari. carpaccio fantastic. meatball tastes made little italy city. visit Oscars every visit Vegas. just fantastic. service great but kitchen misfired couple steaks. Medium rare shouldn't come medium well server did best resolve issue but unfortunately just can't uncook steak.

While waited replacement steak provided additional sides dessert tray which all very good. But places paying excellence...and just didn't happen time. Okay. 2.5 stars. Overall okay great. Certainly worth $$$.  service sketchy. Less 1 minute sat down approached server that's good!? asking drink order. asked minute re coats even off time.  17 minutes later no water no re visit no menu...the floor manager Cody think... asked if helped. really replied. Water menus drink orders followed.  Thank Cody!
Food unremarkable  other reviews indicate. high end quality prices would suggest. Bread water delivered well appetizer served. prime rib good great. guess Choice Select beef roast Prime. Note Oscar Vegas primo meat purveyors. You're telling Prime ?  say mid west Brother Please! Spouse's filet very nice although requested blue cheese  topping did appear steak. requested second time delivered chunks cold side plate most filet consumed. Sides au gratin spinach served room temp hot. Portions large. 
Our first two wine list choices available made third choice. credit offered third choice 2nd choice price again thank Cody! But time he obviously embarrassed weary apologizing. felt badly guy .
Suggestion Oscar Hire top notch manager pay attention inventory control train wait staff some basics customer service skills they appear want good job buss staff working really hard but chaos norm staff busy room which despite your mediocre food service offering still seem enjoy buy better quality beef roasts. keep taking $ chump Vegas visitors laugh all way bank...either way won't back. say Oscar's? staff super friendly very attentive. ordered 12oz Filet. Medium rare. paired glass Pinot noir several sides. group 6 special attention each amazing. Being only guy group didn't mind being asked order last. service food made it. Located used Firefly inside Plaza Hotel Downtown Las Vegas definitely say check out. prices very fair hunk Filet got. would definitely back again! ***here's update dining Sat 2 19 12***  Skip down if u want pre dining review.

Our reservations 7pm course 6 showed 8pm.  Jack manager location he host did best could seated asap.  place bustling roughly 30mins later seated window overlooking Fremont experience.  short glad gambled Jack instead taking easy way many other choices vegas.  would dine Oscar's again.  

The bread butter came quickly delicious.  onion loaf perfectly crisp outside moist chewy center.  best avoid carbs night but no avoiding 3 4 rounds table.  All still raving next morning.     

A buddy prime rib sampling made regret ordered anything else.  big Lawry's fan but blew water.  filet wasn't bad but dating victoria secret model pool sports illustrated models.  Everyone enjoyed entree.

Service attentive server really hustled us.  drinking being rambunctious he managed without hitch.  water drinks when wanted them.

No dessert needed rush club.

The 'Broads' novel idea under different circumstances might added experience.  Good logistics 'knowing your audience' because didn't bug all.     

***pre dining review***
Firstly haven't dined but resv couple weeks update rating actual experience.  current rating judgement call purely based conversation manager duty Jack Yelp reviews.

Friends big Yelpers read good bad some inbetween.  try avoid anything 4 star below.  However also love trying new places moreover love dt vegas having Oscar Goodman's name door gave novel appeal.  Yes he may personally overcook steak any other god fearing consigliere but sure he offer can't refuse pull right people.

Short called because wanted take negative reviews offer assurances rid gremlins grown new restaurant pains.  Conversation could gone two ways.  First reply would could defensive dismissive considering Oscar Goodmans name recognition fact he captive audience being Plaza Hotel's fine steakhouse.  response would made more leery would gone established 4 star.  didn't.  Instead Jack manager took true owner operator approach owned past mistakes very earnst fact defintely through some new reataurant pains but they've since righted ship.  He didn't any exuses offered word handshake through phone.  gave confidence keep reservation looking forward actual experience.  Stay tuned... Oh...my...god! best steak life here. 8 oz. Filet tender gobsmacked. mashed potatos wer creamy delicious wished skipped salad. Caesar salad kind blah. bread bring wonderful want eat lot but better save room your entree. tablemates ordered rib eye ginormous. She couldn't finish someone else tried. He said tasted totally different filet. He ordered mac cheese extremely happy it. 
A great place splurge then walk off under lights Fremont street experience. Since lot talk service just wanted put two cents in. company having holiday party tonight realized all Christmas Chaos gift certificate issued Oscar's set expire. fantastic Natashia White extremely helpful polite honestly made Christmas season much better.

In world where customer service usually consists rather rude individual putting hold eternity can't speak highly enough Natashia everyone Oscar's. If every business run way would much better city. no doubt mind again certainly refer others well. 

A big thank  Merry Christmas Oscar's Natashia. very nice elegant restaurant. nicest downtown. food good but opinion good price. party 4 surf turf 3 sides. Steak good but great. steak cooked medium eat came under cooked. steak strange taste bad. usually never send food back but edible. Especially since $50. did take back cooked another steak which good. Although when new steak back sides gone rest party already ate. did very graciously comp meal inconvenience without asking. believe good restaurant overall. 1.5 STARS Food

There definitely room improvement when comes service. dinner asked if would dessert. said yes. waiter disappeared 5 minutes only return tell he could find dessert menu. The restaurant full. empty tables. ran somehow he able locate dessert menu? When time check waiter nowhere found. assistant waiter told waiter back 3 minutes.

Onto food Lobster Bisque $8 Mediocre. bit salty side.
Fish Day $32 Bass bland. honest didn't even finish it. tasted something cheap buffet. Very disappointing.
Creme Brulee $7 8 Mediocre. caramelize finish really achieved. actual creme part lacked vanilla. However did enjoy fresh fruit strawberry raspberry etc. Now broads? mean name restaurant curious this. soon seated quick see were. weren't skanky looking anything. Just pair girls looked any other girls would find walking around club wearing little black dress. sat down table 3 guys couple rounds drinks then left. Didn't really any effect dining experience. 

However would recommend dismissing broads using capital focus dishes which sadly need work. charging main courses anywhere between $25 $40+ plate having taste something dime dozen buffet line real shame. 

Would recommend place? think not. The only reason why ate because dinner comped. If pay own pocket think review would've lot angrier. Haha Tried many steak house strip  place most  Great time.  Best steak town. Must try crab cake. Great customer service best if best food ever eaten Vegas !!!  food service beyond exceptional !!!  new celebration spot !!!  Thanks Oscar !!!!

We sat right window view Freemont street.

We started signature onion bread accompanied soft butter. bread fresh soft delicious.

I ordered 8 oz filet husband ordered 12 oz filet both cooked medium.  also ordered side corn.

Both steaks cooked perfectly. steaks well seasoned great amount price.

The corn sweet buttery nice compliment steak.

We also ordered 2 glasses red wine. pinot noir husband merlot. Both wines good quality. wine section glass little small.

And last but least server Brad true master he does. He gave perfect amount attention while eating then chatted end meal which liked. 

If looking good steak Vegas Oscars great choice ambiance food service just two hour marathon workout LV. Where eat Vegas? Back hotel recommendation two steak houses which Oscar's  Beef Booze Broads Plaza Hotel Casino opposite hotel Freemont Street

Named Oscar Goodman former mayor Las Vegas plaza above Hash House headed Valentine's Day special $50 prime rib steak smashed potatoes best onion soups tasted while.

This time food portioned just right. able finish everything dark coffee well.

They sexy clientele ladies both customers staff bar although broads staff little bit old taste food first class. Well worth visit. Total cost meal excluding drinks $50+gratuities drinks extra. paid $68 everything. bad steak house. NYC would hitting above $100 quite easily. Ok whole point try some place new did. booth nice able watch show Fremont street. But rest dinner totally average.
The waiters seemed little attitude. waited 20 min before getting drink order even then only cause stopped host ask if order. asked meal when already done ask twice drink refills. He didn't seem friendly when light hearted group.
The food average. tuna appetizer wasn't popping flavor ahi should be. calamari rest table anywhere nothing special. main dish crab stuffed shrimp good great. crab shrimp enjoyed but again sauce food wasn't popping any flavor. asparagus could home. sweet potato wedges good but must white sweet potato imagined sure would ordered. don't tend eat white potatoes. Lastly brought cheesecake birthday aren't much into cheesecake but told good. Now love cobbler some good ones based travels but apple cobbler bland me. don't know if apples used again spices missing. 
I say but doubt would again. Oscar's another example pay .  wife celebrated anniversary Plaza Oscar's dinner plan.  evening started bar Martinis before dinner.  Rather sitting bar itself chose two very comfortable padded leather chairs small table settled enjoy ambiance.  If weren't best dirty Gin Martinis close split hairs over.  waiter very courteous ensured knew Happy Hour several recommendations event wanted try something other Martinis.  long sat down Oscar's Broads introduced herself made sure knew call if needed anything.

We told table ready slightly before reservation time hostess quick tell could finish enjoying drinks bar bring them table which ever preferred.  waiter ready bill case wanted move right away.  paid moved table.  sat along outer edge restaurant wonderful view intersection Main Fremont Streets.  restaurant even second floor sits front Plaza Hotel Casino.  Surrounded glass raised center section looks isn't really bad seat house.

We happy see man waiter bar moved into restaurant now waiter dinner well.  He fantastic represented Old Vegas class courtesy much part city's reputation.  He treated royalty ensured knew could order another round Martinis or other drinks Happy Hour prices. We did course. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail start meal Filet Mignon Oscar style dinner smashed potatoes creamed spinach sides.  Everything prepared perfectly.  portions weren't excessive but enough food could taken leftovers home.  waiter ensured glasses never empty never pushy didn't rush all even took time talk dinner.  ate saw Broad move casually through restaurant several times ensuring any all questions answered sitting guests conversation when asked.  When done meals waiter check ready.  pleasure tip generously truly superior service.

We can't wait head back Oscar's.  many more things menu we'd try we're excited experience equally amazing service again again.  If live Vegas haven't gone Oscar's yet find time go.  If you're visiting want special evening enjoy some Old Vegas hospitality right where all began down original Las Vegas Strip sure save night go.  won't regret it! Came Thursday night seated immediately. Broad came greeted which plus!

I order Sally's 14oz New York Strip Joey C's Filet Mignon side order Alaskan King crab legs. steaks made perfection rare medium rare . 

When crab legs came extremely disappointed see portion amount offer price paying. happy. measly two legs placed dish front me.

Another thing really fond caramelized onions. thought swallowing spoonful sugar every bite onions. sweet standardized caramelized onions am used to.

Overall server very nice knowledgeable menu items! delivers nice ambiance date night! Geez...Can just say Shoestring potatoes stop??? Well can...but won't. could live off those!!! Filet mignon done perfection. Corn brûlée missed. Pork chops tender flavorful. Caesar salad tasted anchovies which rare. Only disappointment crab stuffed shrimp. glad didn't order taste friend's. wonderful ALL. Oh more thing...I thought ordered filet Oscar style. came plain. Friend Oscar style. GLAD WAY DID!!! Oscar style delish but way rich. best meals long time. YUMMERS. good 1. Amazing happy hour bar 50% off beer! Can't $3 blue moon! Awesome price
2. crab cakes amazing. Huge chunks crab meat perfect ratio meat filler. outside also perfectly crispy right amount crunch
3. MUST repeat MUST order Chocolate Mousse dessert. best thing ate all night. Layers fluffy clouds mousse bottom layer rich rum flavor? espresso? could pin down but kept drawing spoon back more more bites until scraping plate clean.
4. onion dinner bread different delicious. service great dinner bread did come table until appetizers served then cleared. But bread great warm cheese baked top. always tell good restaurant dinner bread pretty good.

The Mediocre Chopped salad salad already came pepper much just overwhelmed whole palate. candied pecans seemed place. When would actually bite into just seemed strange did well rest flavor profile. onion strings top stale. If crunchier would enough texture replace candied pecans. 

To pass 1. Sally's New York Strip sorry say should pass steak even though steak house. steak cooked perfectly good grill marks perfectly charred but no flavor! lacked seasoning salt. Sorry say wish steak sauce but didn't want rude ask it. Also meat little tough. tender would expect higher end steakhouse. 
2. cheesecake good. dense. You're better off going cheesecake factory if you're craving cheesecake. 5 star rating happy hour lounge.  Great prices rail drinks appetizers great value same things double price attached restaurant .  Don't miss place when downtown Vegas!

I especially recommend shrimp cocktail crab cakes.  3 huge shrimp great bite flavor.  2 somewhat small crab cakes but full lump crab minimal filler.  meatballs good but nothing special very dense. anniversary. waited ten minutes while hostess Noelia gave table window celebrate. really sweet made big impression us. Then all down hill there! took 20 minutes drinks husband bar himself drinks that. served two totally different colored tasting apple martinis waiter brought other husband ordered. bread basket came cold without butter. soup luke warm even thought ordered steaks medium well red could moved off plates!  spoke manager duty believe name Adam he brought new drink said he comping other one. But husband already bar drinks he never came back 2nd drink.  still charged drink never 2nd which already paid for. end night husband didn't feel talking anyone anymore just paid $147.00 bill left. also paid spinach never received. definately anniversary never forget!  looking forward going am embarassed former Mayor put name restaurant.....this place never it! Should gone Texas de Brazil...where original plans made! Another really fine steak house downtown Las Vegas.  Downtown working overtime shed its image place where busloads white haired old ladies play penny slots high list improvements some really first rate restaurants rival anything Strip.  Oscar's Plaza such.

The room itself stunning its floor ceiling glass dome its views Fremont Street.  arrived early side hoping window table fronting Fremont did.  didn't even ask.  hostess very nice took right best table room.  waiter Scott took drink orders promptly.  tend pay attention bread basket restaurants because think shows attention detail or lack thereof .  bread Oscar's fabulous fresh baked loaf onion bread.  raved way Scott brought two loaves complimentary bread take home us.

Scott very attentive throughout meal both helpful menu personable chatting things history room seems used site Plaza's rooftop pool.  

The menu quite few twists which going leave adoring food thinking isn't quite right.  example wife both started onion soup which made veal stock wife loved while thought little salty veal stock that .  Next crab cakes which quite large served two very good sauces but which little short lump crab meat.  wife wedge salad which Scott chopped request enjoyed it.  bit heavy blue cheese which made strongly flavored.  entree bone in rib eye which fine steak flavorful properly cooked but little heavy fat gristle cap.  best steak but pretty good.  wife crab stuffed jumbo shrimp which she thought excellent.  Both plenty food left take home dinner tomorrow night.

Prices steak high side similar restaurants charge but much menu pretty good deal.  case good deal aspect given boost TravelZoo voucher which allowed door under $200 tax tip drinks wine included.  top off complimentary valet parking Plaza unexpectedly breeze.  very satisfied back. Well reading other reviews people don't know relax ... walked everyone nice sat Italian side service great small problem which fixed gave free desert !!! All five loved meal !! Wow 3 years ago guess didn't hit post whoops . Well back last Sat . Italian side gone disappointed but stayed . steak house great all four loved food esp. Tirumiso end !! Sorry Oscar but let down tonight.

First know going bad night when start off attitude hostesses. Ya can't table but wait table even through your whole meal table could sat never used.... good.

Second while your fault really sucks view blocked bummer. would also help if hotel would clean nasty dirty dome glass once while.
 
So now let's talk meal if drink alcohol could fooled me. Chopped salad good started give hope. Then came steak good. Dry chewy friends came raw. Wife stuffed shrimp liked it... 

So when waiter pretty talkative he likes place much better say Flemings Flemings heart over place.

So tried didn't care all hype but now say tired it.

Hope better luck did. came meet friends bar. Staff friendly ish but waitress didn't seem know handle more few people. ticket changed 3 times even paying. 

Happy hour good deal brushetta amazing! Can't wrong calamari crab cakes either. Oscar B. Goodman Dinner Series Scoundrel Charmer fantastic! Every time Oscar speaks entertained. man treasure trove stories shouldn't miss opportunity hear talk good ol days. 
As restaurant great spot! Awesome views downtown bar cool vibe. Pick Oscar's signature martini. 
Our dinner banquet style event pulled off swimmingly. Lots choices. Service top notch. filet mignon cooked perfectly. best part night once wine glass empty. Cheers having hit Oscar's! classy place!  Service great.  ordered Tomahawk $20 3 sides.  Great meal.  

Looking forward going again! few days ago birthday guy myself both off work reservation six.  early 5 30 no problems seating earlier time which great prepared wait. perfect view end Fremont street. server very friendly pleasure throughout dinner well busser secondary server. Lenora primarily took care Maria kept glasses full table clean. food very fresh delicious. crab cakes blackened shrimp entrees the prime rib filet standouts.  prime rib very large plenty take home.  desserts fantastic able try several.  head chef Jeff came personally check dinner going he also did same several other tables.  time dinner over place packed smiling laughing faces. never such impeccable service start finish restaurant felt some sort celebrity being waited hand foot having crumbs neatly cleaned away glass always full. Oscar's really made last birthday 20's memorable great date night guy. Thank Jeff Lenora Maria! certainly back again near future. 
Thanks making birthday evening over top amazing. Everything fantastic.  ahi tuna chop salad bone Rib steak smashed potatoes turtle lava cake alamode. Rib steak cooked perfectly. Bobby waiter made experience very memorable. entire staff friendly engaging thoroughly enjoyable. would back heart beat. must when Vegas. Made reservations on line requested booth. sat near stairs upper dinning no view no booth. Reviewing wine list extensive over priced decided order glass. Nice pour any standards receives few stars. ordered Caesar salad start. Big salads decent flavor good price. main dish wife chicken Big Chris Steak. chicken good wife seemed enjoy. steak good. New York gamey taste smell texture taste venison. told waiter he reported back manager. manager argued wet aging process nothing wrong steak. asking any compensation he did take steak off bill. encounter presented bill no ask coffee desert. When asked why overlooked waiter indicated told manager done. waiter apologized then asked if would coffee desert. indicated no thank you! did tip waiter over 20% total if steak bill.

Observation getting going but seems place lacks experience. broads gimmick does seem work just seems annoy customers. Competition big upscale steakhouses Vegas. If don't changes it. back. Oscar's Steakhouse located Plaza just above valet front property. Once enter casino just take elevators second floor Oscar's right there!

We dined party seven really enjoyed fantastic meal here! + Happy Hour specials run 4 7 pm every single day week!

Great service definitely provided! + Ambiance vibe very freaking cool. steakhouse old school Vegas feel it. If know all know LOVE stuff all day long! 

This fantastic experience! While necessarily cheap fairly priced especially when compared some other Steakhouses town. would definitely come again. If anything see coming back just some those HH specials crab cakes! 

4 stars.

I am absolutely fan! favorite spot Vegas grab great steak great atmosphere some awesome views. Try your best Robert Bobby waiter. Top notch service! You'll feel your classic Vegas! 
Appetizers well proportioned salad wedge exceeded expectations Roy's artichoke Au gratin world. Steaks cooked perfection. Clean face onion strings melts your mouth. Great value your dollar! Latest update Kevin B back Oscars couple other times since initial visits.  growing love place...the food atmosphere sans showgirl service both bar wait staff.  establishment easily earn fifth star when chance explore menu couple more times.

This last visit wood plank salmon corn brulee.  Fantastic both accounts!  salmon delicious fresh piping hot.  corn brulee made very sweet crisp corn kernels...not sure figured would mushy but even close new favorite side dish!

Highly recommended...great happy hour too! Popped party eight no reservations Valentine's Day celebrate mom's 60th birthday! Luckily eight top lounge! Live music great curtains should open view. 
Service super friendly but slow going start should've prepared more servers lounge. 
They offering three course menu v day $60 $85 wine pairings. Four two Scallops filet. Two others NY strip pork chop flank steak. all shared bites because family! all food amazing!! I'd say NY strip best even though wasn't selection. 
This review might gotten five stars but fact grandma's dessert included three course meal took 20 minutes longer ours noticed later charged extra combined 45 minute wait check put damper experience. 
Also secretly told server celebrating 60th birthday she never even mentioned much less did anything special. really restaurant great memories  view amazing Fremont street. only reason 2 stars instead 0 because waitress Jessica very nice good service entertainment!  Larry always puts good show!  usually only happy hour beef carpaccio amazing best deal happy hour menu. Last night having dinner friends. highly recommended try bone ribeye the most expensive steak menu $64 awful. Super chewy tough.  Wish could refund!!  really warm even asking air turned down nothing. whole table uncomfortable! Excellent. started off shrimp appetizer crab cake. shrimp nice large crab cakes control delicious. weren't over seasoned great crab flavor. crab large flavorful chunks which great! 
I rib eye dinner girl fish. steak Oscars style which some crab meat it. Delicious again. thought service just okay. would've expected more steakhouse caliber. But food made it! would definitely back! group came whim.  didn't know expect scantily clad women dealers tables half casino being renovated below.  look decor restaurant loved it.  ordered prime rib $34 which massive perfect.  steaks halibut which all delicious.  group 6 extremely good experience.  server warm hilarious.  Older fellow just experienced friendly.  Loved dude.  table last  Saturday night attentive last minute left.  

We coming back. amazing experience Oscar's tonight. server Tasha knowledgeable entire menu. She made suggestions throughout dinner which spot on. entire team provided excellent service beginning end. food amazing. Everybody raved food ordered. cooked seasoned perfection. top off chocolate chip cookie la mode desert seriously die for. Oscars comes highest recommendation. yourself favor try if downtown. ambiance old Vegas old money restaurant. People dressed suit tie ladies coats on. Nice change casual Vegas strip. Good service great food. delicious slice prime rib mashed potatoes. ambience absolutely amazing. also enjoyed crab cakes . wife want Oscars celebrate birthday. recommended local friend. When saw downtown hesitant. Off Fremont street made even more worried. wanted something memorable classy. 

Turns touristy fears unfounded. Oscars amazing. restaurant very well done sat over looking Fremont street but couldn't hear any obnoxious noise. 

The last time Vegas Ruth's Chris loved it. Oscars better. shared HUGE rib eye. perfect no fatty just perfect. Did mention perfect. 

We smashed potatoes brussels sprouts sides. Very tasty. 

Our waiter Bobby attentive polite quite funny. Manager Jeff came twice sure having good time even Oscar's assistant stopped because Oscar wanted sure being taken care nice touch. 

We felt whole staff really cared experience. awesome. plan come back next time Vegas. Came Thursday happy hour girl friends.
Starting bit info because website says ladies half off drinks Thursdays... informed no longer doing they should probably take blurb off menu . Happy hour goes until 7pm includes white red house wine well drinks several beers select appetizers.

Service bit underwhelming. waitress almost throwing herself table men next barely paying attention us.

That being said food place made it. crab cake app much crab meat I'd happily pay regular price them! homemade ricotta delicious paired nicely tomato mix. ran crustinis but still scooping cheese tomato mix silverware. Calamari nice crispy not amazing other two but those hard beat .

Happy hour white wine chardonnay but nice smooth I'm fan dry chard . 

Great place Fremont happy hour. ambiance great but service food need help.

This second visit Oscar's both cases service extremely slow servers nice but think need more 2 bar area busy night more slow night.

The charcuterie plate great when ordered 2 ample 4 people.  down hill.  three meatball appetizer came cold middle Ahi Tuna appetizer came wasabi ginger but absolutely no soy ponzu sauce dipping.  ask why put wasabi paste plate if you're going give sauces dipping?  server drink orders wrong thought odd would want bread actually come charcuterie plate...

My martini glass leftover soap residue which tainted very simple Kettle straight twist As local know return enjoy some new spots popping downtown only hope Oscar's strive become better place eat vs. just drink. throwback old school Vegas. Beef Booze Broads tag line INDEED!  While food perfect service certainly was. big fan great service even if food may lack quality character. view stunning atmosphere fun comfy music good throwback old school Vegas lounge acts. came during Happy Hour specials pleasant surprise. Half off certain cocktails appetizers. only wished would told when Happy Hour over price drinks changed quite bit.  Appetizers bit off well shrimp cocktail calamari def frozen fresh but prepared served well. strip steak $48.00 cooked tasted perfection. All all would come back again steer clear any fish menu don't think fresh fare department. steaks atmosphere friendly service worth trip though if downtown Fremont Vegas. Ill back. Ate during annual AFC NFC championship weekend Vegas. Love craps golden Gate some cheaper tables right across street. 

The restaurant upstairs having reservations sat bar but nice table full service there. 

They must hire waitresses based appearance because all waitresses very attractive.

Crab cakes very good lots crab no filler. steaks excellent.  warning yelp free glass wine per table break group if want more one.

Prices normal higher end steakhouse but better value some high end places Vegas.

Would recommend. Absolutely amazing! Aside love Goodman's  food perfect service spot on.   beef carpaccio delicious! Steak perfect char seafood fresh.  sure visit again Great atmospheres wonderful staff.  Wait service top notch.  Food excellent.

I strip rare.  Steak charred outside pink circle below red center.  Absolutely perfect!  Fat perfectly crisped cook spot throughout.

Sides excellent well.  Extremely fresh asparagus delicious smashed potatoes.

This best steakhouse Vegas certainly best steaks ever had.  would highly recommend.  Monday night well. place great. Service amazing. Prices high but expected quality receive. best way explain place exceptional quality simple ingredients. American steak house without all fluff. medium rare prime rib best most true prime rib had. really skeptical place. friend booked restaurant given namesake throwback old school vegas thought would good idea. read yelp reviews ready some bad service some bad food. friend called ahead reassurances bad reviews just opening problems.

I must say happy here.  ambience nice. Upscale old school feel place. modern. Being downtown vegas clientele seemed more older midwest southern crowd.  

Was best steak had? No. 
Was good because really low expectations? Probably
Was enhanced fact we'd drinking couple hours prior? Likely

The bread awesome! can't tell much stuff ate. menu bit limited. crabcakes which excellent not alot breading .  Also tried lobster bisque which pretty good alot places salty but just right Had new york strip which cooked just right nice char outside. Another member party prime rib which say excellent!

Would come back but many other great places eat vegas probably won't. But would still recommend give place try Paid strip prices didn't strip service. Recently dined here. server inattentive did provide level service would expect steakhouse any kind. while but wife dined several times past friends certainly hadn't experience before. Obvious lack effort very frustrating. brought management's attention hopefully address... food itself good would expect. sides meant two but need per person average appetite. word AMAZING!.  am steak lover love eat steak great steak hard find.  Oscar's surpassed expectations quality taste service atmosphere.  sat window where clear view into Fremont Street server Bobby top notch.  He friendly knowledgeable courteous.  certainly enjoyed visit Oscar's Plaza.  locals love eating truly found new favorite place eat.  take parent's next time come visit.

RECOMMENDATION I Carolyn's cute Prime Rib which more enough two feast ordered side Mac n Cheese which took home late night snack.  portions very generous sides made sharing! Best Steakhouse Fremont. Food matched only excellent service  waitress Jenn. All suggestions spot on. General Manager Cody even stopped table check super friendly accommodating. He made Anniversary special sending wonderful chocolate mousse well champagne. don't miss destination restaurant screams old Vegas remains unmatched downtown area. Highly recommend especially picky foodie! 
Trust Go Tomahawk!!! Oscars Steakhouse . . . excellent meal steak perfection rare tender. asparagus Brussel spouts great. waiter friendly informative quick. Highly recommend place Great dining experience. brought town friends loved it. Highly recommended! Absolutely blown away place. place super cool amazing view vibe. onion bread blow away. NY strip which flavorful perfectly cooked request. sides also great favorite which corn dish. place must if your Vegas. Bar 2 stars
Restaurant 3 stars
Service 3 stars
Value 3 stars

The bartender piss poor atitude poured lousy drink. 

The crab cakes great scallops overcooked shrimp cocktail just average. 

Our party following entrees sides 2 skirts steaks neither them really enjoyed 1 filet oscar style he enjoyed 1 filet cooked prefection 1 strip overcooked. Sides dishes creamed spinach roasted potatoes mashed potatoes corn gratin.

The service good however staff refined prices charge. did expect lot since downtown clientele show wearing t shirts shorts.

The overall value OK prices just little under strip pricing. 

For 20 more dollars per person recommend STK Joes Stone Crab Capital Grill Del Frisco great drinks food service. place all charm Vegas yesteryear. felt stepping back time really upped value book. love feeling part experience rather just sitting down meal. restaurant near Golden Nugget view people zip lining strip whatever called don't know much downtown Vegas . service decent enough but didn't really feel waitress came around often. Fortunately glasses always filled water thanks other members staff. filet evening better night before yes wanted clog arteries having steak two nights row . other side items okay. baked potato butter sour cream but butter wouldn't melt because potato wasn't really hot . no didn't want taken back because schedule didn't want late Hamilton. Overall okay experience. Again reiterate steak delicious! I'd evening full ambiance. some very interesting patrons Oscar's. People watching alone would fun! first experience awesome couldn't wait come back.  thought best service wine food atmosphere.  time total 180. Note waiter listening skills Last time split every dish separated equally plated. time he hacked into steak table. Presentation ruined! Steak knifes came steak when does happen steak house? When he came check wasn't until reach manager. time all food cold. When waiter came apologize he said if chef slice kitchen would extra charge. challenge find button POS  system. If bad enough when check came waiter swarming around table shark hunt. Clearly experience celebration but waiter. Eaten multiple times..... Atmosphere Food Staff Always Great.... Only thing suggest valeting your car cause parking all way other end casino... visited few nights ago dinner. food ok best part being free bread served. service left something desired though. Very beautiful view windows. back try rest menu. walked off street dressed tourists daiquiris hanging off necks clearly dressed properly location. no reservation but offered seats bar where full menu available. asked take yard sticks off bar very reasonable treated very well. Long review say treated very well clearly looking high class. meal outstanding prices much less other steak places. Highly recommended! Nice place. Love view. Food very average. Chicken processed. Rubbery. Service good. Wine list very small. place old Vegas feel cool view Fremont. Food very good. crab stuffed shrimp side Mac cheese way go. Suggest reservations walk Wednesday night hour. Happy hour all night glass wine $6 but Jameison $10.. Seems steep whiskey $20 glass regular price. seated hour time then waited 15 minutes no server. Caught attention support staff related them. Bradley came over said he sorry he would serve until figured table. Ordered lobster crab bisque. Best ever had!!
Manager  came over comped appetizer which chose calamari. good but spectacular. Ordered Oscar's chopped salad which came topped onion straws. Good salad but definitely meal salad $11. 
Checked Yelp scored free dessert which cheesecake. cheesecake awesome!!
Overall good very good ambience very romantic but service kitchen organization suspect table next several issues wrong steaks being delivered. big yelper. But share experience Oscar steakhouse last night. Im 2nd generation Las Vegan always bucket list try. good friend mine customer promotion company definitely much needed celebration dinner. made reservations OpenTable oscars called couple hours before confirm we're still party 10. When showed valet car somehow knew name asked if party then parked car front casino that really cool . 
We then upstairs greeted respectfully sat table amazing then course ordered famous Oscar Martini made perfect did disappoint. glanced over menu already knew wanted wanted eat Oscar Goodman man looked long time.  parents grandparents would always tell stories Las Vegas used when growing would explain would dressed friends significant other enjoy casinos. believe lot forgotten over years seen growing up. But glad Oscar kept place way he did. classy little gangster felt Oscar Goodman night LOL. must try place if you're town especially if your local. Las Vegas truly represents proud Las Vegan. Thank Oscar Goodman keeping gangster boyfriend came dinner just such nice dinner that. shrimp cocktails huge full flavor. view restaurant just fun incredible Fremont . small close intimate setting just loved chandelier well waiter polite sweet great dinner Oscars overlooking Fremont Street. Great View great food. crab stuffed shrimp. see Scinta brothers show hotel afterwards. great old style Vegas show. Don't miss it. Read review some trepidation. hesitating try Oscar's. Finally decided come Wednesday. Glad came. bone rib steak superb sides pretty solid dessert also excellent though ridiculously oversized some cases looks portions Heart Attack Grill down street . variety strong Joe Vicari Andiamo D but quality excellent. Service also superb order done just right decided against booking weekend most reviews showed problems order times.  back ! food all top notch best steaks ever had. stories old Vegas great show girls work there. Before give honest feedback visiting Oscar's first time want know am local am supporter all things downtown am avid supporter Oscar Carolyn both. But restaurant total complete miss us.

Bread onions? Onions?? Awful.
Chopped salad very nice flavors embarrassingly small portion.
Onion soup nicely presented but weird taste.
Filet mignon ordered medium well very dry inside. offered served any sauces all peppercorn example.
New York portion very generous also overcooked taste very boring. No marinade no flavor again no sauce.
Sides does every side bread crumbs? Couldn't taste difference between macaroni cheese corn because both drowning bread crumbs. Baked potato very dry seemed sitting very long time.
Tiramisu bad great.
Service waited long time greeted even though when arrived only 3 4 tables. Busser excellent seemed he cared much more server. But all small details missing drinks filled very quickly no decrumbed table until time dessert even though needed it much care arrange silverware between courses etc. 
ALSO when made reservation stated anniversary. But never even mentioned acknowledged server maitre d' manager no one. single sound it.

We eat every single night really hoped great experience. really know restaurant scene Las Vegas know expect different price points. But unfortunately restaurant falls FAR short even lesser price point.

Honestly very disappointed especially special occasion us. place served best meals ever had! years admired fun ambiance distance finally decided treat myself. great treat was! First all service great! manager even came sure meal liking. friend opted bone in filets macaroni cheese asparagus mashed potatoes chocolate mousse dessert. did disappoint! certainly coming back. Wow. many years Vegas no idea restaurant named Mr. Oscar Goodman love admire. 

Located Plaza Hotel shaped circle shape way nobody cheated view.... seated center restaurant STILL able enjoy view downtown area. restaurant walls glass windows also offers bar area before after. Very classy feel yet feeling old fashioned Vegas mobster. 

Tried Carolyn Cut Steak AMAZING! Extremely huge supposed smaller version Oscar cut but GINORMOUS! place must try especially if you're Vegas native. Don't listen those bad reviews place great!  Great view great service great management.  prices normal Vegas if looking $15 filet mignon visit Kansas but you're going find decent Vegas less $35 $40 most places Strip start them $45 $50 Oscar's line.  Would see better wines glass but only thing would change...and wines did glass overpriced others said again if want $5 glass wine stick poker bars high end steakhouse.  definitely back. need thier game serving bread no cheese served olive oil instead butter. husband heard Oscar's years finally decided give try. Thursday night only moderately busy patrons. waited 10 minutes greeted server he apologized said another server would assisting him. other server promptly showed took drink order. then ordered Blue cheese salad wedge French onion soup. husband ordered special steak night huge bone ribeye $65 ordered small cut prime rib side mashed potatoes.  salad wedge arrived but onion soup did not. 10 minutes attention server asked where soup was. He apparently didn't hear remember ordered it. arrived your typical onion soup nothing special. steaks arrived looked beautiful. husbands ribeye die for! He said best he's ever had! hot seasoned well cooked perfection!  prime rib another story luke warm little no taste but super tender full fat which love. $9.00 mashed potatoes hot enough melt butter added. thing hated restaurant blaring pop music! love old school Vegas vibe but pop music ruined me. music would hear dance club. couldn't wait leave. would recommend spending your time money just down street Hugo's Cellar basement Four Queens. ate night before eaten over 16 years. BEST!! Thank Justin Joyce Courtney making husband's birthday party memorable last night!   such GREAT time well all friends.

Oscars AMAZING steakhouse.  food service BEST!  Always 5 stars!  See all real soon First foremost love Goldman's done Las Vegas.

Both excellent...great presentation served hot tasted wonderful  husband some sort steak topped crab meat version chopped salad. He clean plate ranger.

 fun dressed fancy steak house Vegas.  say prices very reasonable.

My dirty martinis done well even drunk lady sitting table next rambled slurred may fit better awesome Oscar's is.  husband politely picked off ground she tripped way out.  Yep fun night sure! food delicious! bus lady friendly she constantly came around asked if needed more water. water wasn't friendliest looked he didn't want there. coupon 10% through Yelp which applied total. However when told lady told free dessert anniversary stated no  correct which fine. But also birthday he ignored fact said no. wasn't fight cheesecake. felt he should just given us. But said felt he didn't want there. would definitely come food Great Las Vegas place 
Good food good service great bake round live Vegas style music 
Food good restaurant nice 
It different 
I place Great view. put right front window looking straight down Fremont Experience. Bone Prime Rib largest ever seen tender great flavor. extra person above reservation graciously accommodated without any fuss.

Outstanding meal service.

I just wish would moved containers fill them rather dumping stack them crowded table fill. 2nd time Oscars.  first experience Oh Wow! .  2nd time bit disappointment.

To start things off cocktail waitress inside bar no clue custom drinks menu.  She wasn't even familiar names drinks!  ordering cocktails table became available.  hostess said she would cocktail waitress bring drinks table.  took 15 minutes finally drinks.  martini supposed bleu cheese olives regular olives instead.  did finally them but took cocktail waitress couple more requests another 15 minutes.  also surprised couldn't transfer bar tab dinner check.

Moving dinner seafood wife mother ordered very good.  prime rib Oscar bone in cut least 50% fat!  cut meat should never left kitchen.  real kicker cold.  just lukewarm cool....but COLD.  sent back where think just poured hot au jus because still wasn't very warm.

As service disappointed waiter.  He never even acknowledged mother's birthday even though informed hostess upon checking and tipped $20! .  When waiter brought prime rib sent back he did wait while tested nor did he ever check back see if satisfied entree.  end meal he commented much prime rib still left plate.  replied all fat left...and he simply laughed!

I expect excellent food excellent service when enjoying fine restaurant especially when average bill Oscar's around $100 per person.  am sorry say recommend restaurant others nor back.  two small mistakes understand but series them throughout night unacceptable!  service overall experience Oscar's just plain sloppy.  many other amazing restaurants Las Vegas right every time. Let preface review saying did steak. But gone culinary school food did quite disappointing really glad didn't order steak. hate having send food back when dining group which was prediction steak would've needed sent back.

Oscars bills itself first class steakhouse.  I'd expect chef premises tasting food making sure everything excellent.  strongly suspect isn't case.  When looking $100 per person without drinks expect super meal something phoned in.

I ordered beef barley soup which described being made home made stock fresh vegetables along prime rib. stock I strongly suspect house made  it bland greasy nothing stock house.  prime rib chewy. barley under cooked.  husband French onion soup same review  it just awful.

I ordered $15 side lobster mac cheese......the lobster flabby sweet.....I suspect frozen then thawed maybe didn't even squeeze water out.   $15 honestly expected very few pieces lobster but did expect them firm succulent....which why people order lobster or lobster anything .   

My husband ordered he thought entree sized chopped salad came doused much dressing never lost its shape being squished into ring form like restaurants things stacked tuna tartare .  He said mediocre best.

I tasted friends' orders au gratin potatoes okay truffled mashed potatoes very good but $15? .

Honestly if Oscar's wants considered first class steakhouse they're going need game side dishes salads soups. wants dinner brought down fact sides salads appetizers terrible?   If can't those things well then take them off menu. Nothing come close Fremont street even main strip. see why Mayor name restaurant blow your socks off.

Service food drinks all top notch. Steak anyone? Fremont Street place! If fan old Vegas love steak house.. food great! server needs training! Drinks great well!  native Old down town service use too. girlfriend visited Oscar's special celebration reading great reviews seeing pictures very nice view Fremont Street.

The view did disappoint. overlooked west end Fremont Street ambiance restaurant great.

The service food however left feeling sour.  waitstaff excluding bus person rude. whatever reason waiter seemed picking girlfriend seemingly annoyed she sitting there.  watched he hospitable couple sitting next wondered done wrong treat differently frank badly.  He never came back checked both appetizer entree courses only saw when he asked if interested dessert. If he checked all he would known satisfied food.

I say all food bad.  ordered calamari crab cakes appetizer which girlfriend picked when ordering waiter.  apps tasty.  calamari which lacked bit seasoning crispy well marinara sauce.  crab cakes dry flavored well huge chunks crabs.  entree however great.  ordered New York strip came borderline burnt.  burnt ness came through every bite masked all natural meat flavors ruining steak.  would complained except waiter no where found.  But guess fault waving down.

For price would patronize other steakhouses strip even chains Morton's Fleming's. did enjoy experience here. would only recommend place its views maybe appetizers. didn't try anything else menu can't say much that. seeing slogan beef booze broads Anthony Bourdain eating could say no. only food pretty damn good waiter Bobby phenomenal. Bobby very old school everything you'd want waiter attentive able suggestions point right direction ordering pretty pretty much class act. started onion strings which pretty damn good. Then ordered filet which seasoned cooked perfectly enough two. three sides creamed spinach which just okay au gratin potatoes possibly best corn ever roasted corn brûlée. Seriously corn don't share actually order two. If aren't local share because portions generous can't really take leftovers Vegas. But people please remember nice steak house class don't wear your booty shorts your best looking bro shirt. Just because overlooks Freemont Street doesn't mean slum Outback god's sake. found place end Fremont street bar hopping. best place ever. dropped lot coin many Las Vegas restaurant. best food service. If ever own restaurant hope would standard. requested days advance nice table near window great view celebrate parent's anniversary. lingered around hostess stand several minutes since left unattended. Everyone looking more menus when hostess finally came reminded wanted near window good view she sat side restaurant dark side restaurant horrible view even though better window tables available. She ran off before could ask moved. Once said did want order wine waiter he immediately started treat poorly. drink but prepared spend lot food. He ignored entire time items water check other servers. watched waiter ham all other tables completely treat differently. don't know did treated badly.. hard ignore did look differently other tables because only people white restaurant time but cannot confirm waiter racist. horrible anniversary parents poor closing Vegas vacation. food bad meatballs old sent back filet tough rib eye extremely salty. recommend place anyone anything returning. Nice place .Jenifer very good polite very smiling server . restaurant. Recommend everybody. Great ambiance food great value. seated just under glass ceiling really nice view. service great think Bradley served would constantly check if everything's OK including well steak cooked. He quite frank admitting steak wasn't cooked according request yet steak still very yummy! portion quite huge two share. Would definitely come back! Great place happy hour bar area 50% off beer well drinks plus cheap appetizers

$8 Meatballs 2pcs almost good meatball shop generous dollop ricotta cheese!

$12 Prime rib sliders 3pcs meat lower end almost yoshinoya beef bowl. Came au jus dipping sauce. 

$8 Jumbo shrimp cocktail 3pcs really delicious wish came more 3

Overall solid food cheap drinks ambiance beautiful overlooking Fremont experience awesome bartenders. service great even though last ones seated. view spectacular food phenomenal. nice steakhouse prices weren't bad good piece meat. definitely see myself going back. came back July coworkers work gig wrapped. before not.

We seafood platter start pretty meh. Didn't seem fresh. filet mignon dinner good but amazing. did try friend's prime rib really good know order next time.

The ambiance cool but unless Oscar's slinging drinks wouldn't way dine again. Food great insanely good crab cakes just best I'd ever had. Huge portions.

Service  not expected A level steak house. server said short staffed. Hey  problem your management needs things run smoothly even when you're short  the diners should never ever know.  party ordered martini told he'd wait while washed more martini glasses. Ick. other guests said drinks pretty darn weak. Table wasn't bused would expected. Utensils replaced properly. there's hostess chick least  think she keeps wandering wanting conversation. just standing when we're obviously making own conversation we'd eat while meal hot. 

I might back but might just try gazillion other restaurants Vegas. absolutely wonderful experience small dinner reception following friends' wedding Plaza Hotel. immediately loved ambiance lounge. Perfect lighting classy two musicians providing smooth tunes. party 25 people own area middle dining room. all other reviews... amazaball views otherwise crazy Freemont Street. service spot on. Oscar's very prepared waited hand foot. meal exceptional too. most perfectly prepared New York steak EVER had. crabcakes pure divinity don't pass up. Overall very sophisticated delightful meal.  Would love come back. visit Oscar's first time old town Las Vegas.  restaurant seated window seats ovular shaped dining room.  able gaze window different everything looked compared main Las Vegas Strip.  decor definitely old school  felt back into time 80's. 

We came Prime Rib.  all Bone in PRIME RIB Special disappointed.  prime rib HUGE!  shared girl friends couldn't even finish.  meat super tender juicy crust nicely seasoned I love part meat! .  just right amount au jus prime rib served creamy horseradish sauce.  size quality I'd say great deal!

We shared few sides well Lobster Mashed Potatoes Creamed Spinach Sweet Potato Jalapeno Butter sauce.  favorite side lobster mashed potatoes but wish bigger chunks lobster stead shredded pieces.  creamed spinach good but nothing special it.  sweet potatoes weren't very tasty.. pretty much 3 gigantic sweet potato fries served some sweet watery sauce.  did taste buttery nor jalapeno  wouldn't recommend side. 

If ever visit old town Vegas sure stop Oscars some Prime Rib! family favorite spots dinner Vegas. Steaks always delicious service EXCELLENT!!! can't way next Vegas trip!!! love everything place. Excellent steaks old school atmosphere. Excellent professional service without being stuffy..which turns off lot restaurants. Great ingredients well prepared served dignity... Ordered filet mignon cooked medium. small enough eat super delicious. totally fine dining. best meal Las Vegas. boyfriend Roland ate last night anniversary 5 16 16 because met here. When met during company's Christmas party which open bar don't remember food but remember delicious martinis! Honestly many other places would rather gone price point but glad came here. food really really good.

Roland ordered Carolyn's Cut Prime Rib $34 Joey C's Filet Mignon 12 oz $46 side Bearnaise sauce. ordered 2 sides Brussels Sprouts Caramelized Onion Bacon $8 Ralph's Smashed Potatoes $7 . order three sides $20 but couldn't decide third. server Lenore kind knowledgeable menu. She even double checked ingredients chef since gluten intolerant  lucky many choices people allergies.

As food GOOD! couldn't over Filet. ordered medium well cooked perfectly which almost never happens. always order side Bearnaise sauce steak pretty well although just bit tangier. Smashed Potatoes OMG. Order sure! clog your arteries but most deliciously decadent potatoes ever. Roland's prime rib pound weight also very yummy. big fans Lawry's Prime Rib he thinks Oscar's does pretty good job. tried bite delicious! He also used complimentary bread he said amazing soak juices. downfall both disappointed Brussels Sprouts. weren't very memorable all lacked flavor even though cooked onion bacon. nice add little freshness heavy meal but wouldn't order again. entrees Lenore sweet brought cheesecake anniversary. Though couldn't eat Roland enjoyed it. Thank Lenore!

Additionally love restaurant space. totally old school charming. dining room circular windows walls. looks straight down Fremont street least did before scaffolding zip line built. definitely takes away lot but room itself still beautiful. came Monday night just few other tables diners. quiet lighting romantic.

With two entrees two sides glass each house Merlot house Pinot Noir bill came $130. pricey but worth special occasion. probably revisit every year but don't know if wait long Filet Mignon Smashed Potatoes again! Honestly daydreaming right now. Thank Oscar's beautiful dinner! Stumbled upon place night checking Fremont Street night before Christmas eve.   planning eat Hash House downstairs but decided give Oscar's try.  

It delicious.   ordered chicken entree steak lobster prime rib bone rib eye.   wife split ribeye 12oz cut.  food great.  chicken soup which amzing.   all mashed potatoes baked potatoes steak fries.  asparagus tasty too.   Service top notch too.  

Very friendly waiter he shared few stories us.   recommend all family friends.   originally booked another steakhouse Christmas day but prices pretty steep Xmas day menu.   Thus saved ton money.   meal 5 averaged $60 person bad meal Oscar's. Oscars little hidden gem heart downtown Las Vegas. Most people wouldn't think twice going restaurant because location. tourist wouldn't really know find place. situated small local casino Plaza. assume populated mainly locals.  dined upon cousin's recommendation Vegas local true foodie. 

Food incredible! must try rib eye! perfectly cooked well seasoned. portion size HUGE! never such large sized rib eye price. cousin shared plate more enough two us. also ordered fried calamari shrimp cocktail chopped salad. shrimp cocktail probably favorite. 4 pieces jumbo sized shrimp super fresh! chocolate cake damn delicious again don't skimp portion. large slice chocolate cream sauce side two scoops  vanilla ice cream 

Ambiance Gorgeous! center glass chandelier really sets romantic modern vibe. first thing notice walk into restaurant dome shaped glass window. jaw dropping! wide side glass windows really opens space gives entire place truly unique dining experience. sure request window seat way spectacular view flashy downtown Las Vegas! 

Service really can't ask better service there. manager Cody come check few times. He such sweetheart! server Scott nice funny. He came checked regularly made sure satisfied service. Oh! validate your parking. didn't know that! Nice little perk! 

Price Very reasonable considering atmosphere food quality. 


I would definitely come back here. recommend all buddies. prices may bit steep but essentially you're paying unique dining experience. atmosphere 100% different your typical fine dining!  such hidden gem!! sat bar Hors d'oeuvres wine.  Mom crab cakes loved them. server Jennifer she very pleasant attentive. great singer there. name Larry Liso.  He sings buttah!  very good overpowering. am looking forward going back eating dining area. great view Fremont st. Oscar chop salad 12oz beef filet would recommend both. Steak done perfectly. asked where beef though server responded Midwest Illinois think corn Fed . something proud of...it's not. service very good. Apparently place kind if Iconic. owner somewhat celebrity course nothing food but if you're looking touristy spot is. Everything Salvatore order creamed spinach bad creamed corn...actually very good mashed potatoes..had better. Overall if you're looking decent steak good service view looking straight down Fremont st place. food amazing! pork chop bit smoke flavor put portion size more expected. brussel sprouts perfectly paired caramelized onions bacon pieces. lava cake ice cream great fudge center kept flowing lava. fantastic! waiter good but busser seemed impatient take plates away he only cleaning table nothing else do. If could rate Oscar's 6 stars would. everything steakhouse should food service atmosphere view. Just perfect. 
I Caesar salad which nothing fancy but just right. bisque flawless just flavorful spoonful flavorful spoonful.

The highlight clearly steak. put lightly eaten lot steaks day. best. 

I over month ago filet. exaggerating when say mouth watering just thinking it. Just incredibly tender piece beef could literally cut fork. prepared exactly should be nice charred crust little salt little pepper. Nothing else. No crazy nonsense. No BS sauce. Just delicious meat. 

I don't know when next time Vegas is. But if Gods good sure Oscar's still around. recommended all friends undoubtedly visit multiple times during next trip. 

Oh mac cheese amazing too. perfectly acceptable steakhouse meal. filet properly prepared staff quite nice views great. markups wine bottles high but no more everyone else las Vegas. recently added Fremont stage cut into great views bit but even obstruction views restaurant some best city. three steak options when downtown choice holds well against others. heaven last night. huge group pretty much shared everything! restaurant gorgeous. love dome shaped see into hustle bustle Fremont St. yet surrounded elegance. Beautiful atmosphere. Great place date good friends.

Thank wonderful evening! town work couple other guys.  looking good steak halfway reasonable price when found place.  atmosphere great. When walked guy piano lady singing some old time 40s style music.  immediately excited found right place.   seated overlook area where views old Las Vegas strip Fremont street awesome.  place most half full when arrived busy.  THEN waited waited waited some just say hi maybe pour some water.  watched waiter walk multiple times before loudly call attention he passed again acknowledge even existed.   expected come right but he said he would right waited more.   ruined start.   FINALLY when some attention he nice enough guy.  Kind rough which maybe maybe didn't sense atmosphere little confusing.   Ultimately once service quick.  Drinks stayed full food delivered quickly.  Texas great steaks.  46$ 12oz filet mignon.  cooked perfectly good tasting piece meat.  could seasoned little better but all all good tasting piece meat.   46$ steak comes nothing no sides all.  All those extra!  What!!  9$ average each some good sides.  tried steamed asparagus no taste potato wedges which found odd tasting ang aw grotten potatoes which again just ok best.  Strangely Sam Adams beer 5$.  Lol.  everything overpriced except beer.

I give 3 star because service while steak 4 star all sides 3. rate on Atmosphere ambiance Dish taste quality Service
In order 5 stars restaurant must Ace everything. service Oscar's top notch. environment slight old Vegas feel old Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman's place but modern twist. setting downtown Vegas dome above valet loop Plaza Hitel view downtown side street love feel place. food great but 5 star utterly deliciousness say Cut Mastro's but great meal positive vibe. music weird choice though loud pop music.  only thing didn't doesn't match restaurant vibe. typical downtown experience. 8 45 reservation. showed 8 40. waited Ten Minutes host show desk. approximately 10 min over 10 min. 3 waiters 2 bussers attempted track down Justin seat us. He 1 2 full dining room socializing.

The ambiance nice authentic Vegas. Overhead windows lend dining room expansive views downtown Vegas Fremont street. 

Cool bar lots memorabilia. food comfort steakhouse bit pedestrian. ordered chopped salad wedge salad onion soup King Crab legs prime rib. Carolyn cut prime rib left hungry disappointed needing more. waiter good Brad solid performance thanks. When asked take some crab legs busser brought box bag your self . Hmmm.

I ordered $230 bottle wine which wasn't deserving experience. If downtown try Hugo's Cellar Vic Anthony's. Oh Oscar Goodman love you! now your own steakhouse tag line Beef Booze Broads love even more! 

I finally chance visit Oscar's last trip home.  great experience loved everything place.  highlights 1. menu! menu full classic steakhouse fares.  your fancy steaks seafood lots tasty sides.  kicks menu notch many items named Vegas big wigs many known Mafia figures.  Gotta love Oscar style!

2. Great location! resturant located Plaza head Fremont street.  resturant big glass dome some great views Fremont Street even if new zip line blocks some days. 

3. Fantastic service! service top notch. start finish great time!

4. Tasty food! visit filet Oscar topping Spilatro steak named Tony Spilatro guy played Joe Pesci movie Casino Mac n' cheese cream corn brûlée sweet potato fries. filet Oscar fabulous! Spilatro steak which flank steak stuffed garlic marinated garlic red pepper flakes ok.  taste good but bit tough which normal flank steak.  don't think would order again but fun steak try.  sides all unbelievably fantastical taste. Very top notch book. 

5. Oscar's OpenTable your own reservations points too!

I would recommend place anyone mood tasty food great service loves Fremont Street.  also would recommend place because chance Oscar siting which would awesome anyone knows Vegas Mafia history watched Casino. Booze Beef Broads .  Guys night great time.  loved waitress Emma.  

Appetizers meatballs shrimp salads.  Smaller portions other high end steakhouses but delicious.

Entrees 22oz bone ribeye.  Excellent flavor cut.  ordered medium but more medium rare which am okay but next time medium well.  Filet mignon excellent.

Sides mac n cheese asparagus potatoes au gratin.  Smaller portions other high end steakhouses.  Mac n cheese very good asparagus needed butter seasoning potatoes did come Au Gratin dish bland.

Dessert cheesecake berries.  Very creamy best slice cheese cake Vegas.

No Vegas more beloved Oscar Goodman.  lived over 10 years place must try list.  If live Vegas eat least once glad did. recently held convention Plaza few days mainly because location all things Fremont Street Downtown. Prior going scoped place some could sit talk while having cocktails.  

Oscar's perfect that. 

Full Disclosure spent 4 nights bar open close last night dinner.  

Lounge Plopper.  sit watch world by.  Depending your location Oscars perfect this.  3 types seating.  Standard bar top high top tables comfortable chairs couches.  Unlike many lounges bars Fremont Oscar's doesn't cram elbow elbow some stranger danger. 

We discovered first night could happily nosh off menu. extensive cocktail list well full bar.  Sunday night only ones bar lounge portion but restaurant itself quite busy. waiter actually bartender drinks perfection.  

I am die hard bloody Mary girl way back but discovered Carolyn named Honor Ms. Mayor.  menu said made gin but assure works well vodka. alternated between Carolyn Patron margarita.  

At suggestion staff all came over point anther welcome Plaza Oscars caprese salad called Jasper Hunchy's Tomato Salad crab cakes shrimp cocktail.  Excellent light choices.  Oscar's #1 Broad actually 2 different woman made point hang several times night.  Yes just interesting. LOL. 

As succession nights progressed also tried Jose Leonardo's Roasted Corn Brulee Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac Cheese Hymie's Latkes. all side dishes main menu all done extremely well.  

Our last night hosted dinner 6 restaurant.  seated prime location front center window looked straight down Fremont bathed golden light Vegas.   started onion soup continued Nicky's chicken finished shared creme brulee. dinner guest each Carolyn cut prime rib various toppings sides. NOTE sides very plentiful certainly shared family style appetizers. Since locals used 9.99 prime rip. Carolyn those cut cooked perfection. total bill 6 including several rounds cocktails under $300.00 20% tip.  

Since still early retired back spot lounge.  Imagine surprise delight MAN himself came over sat us.  

Going Oscar's won't find yard long drinks fishbowls full cheap liquor but find throwback when people dressed dinner cocktails 6pm considered experience instead just getting drunk possible.  Ok did some too.  

2nd Full disclosure nightly bar bill anywhere 2 6 people ran $150.00 per night.  Well worth finding little gem heaven watch world by. Service excellent. Food great. Atmosphere top notch. return. Best view Freemont Street plus Old Time Vegas feel. ambiance wonderful staff great! drinks decent. Starting off shrimp cocktail. cocktail sauce nice spicy tell made rather coming jar. shrimp very large more prawns! slightly waterlogged but still good. next Cesar salad. Now love traditional Cesar salads anchovies raw egg think delicious. husband other hand never real traditional Cesar salad said he prefers Kraft Cesar dressing Oscars served. each own that. when dinner took turn worst. ordered halibut cauliflower purée sautéed spinach. spinach good great seasoning. fish hard least bit flaky point needed knife cut off bite size piece. no seasoning all. Also virtually no purée little tasteless. Seriously fish horrible red lobster ten times better! also disappointed caramelized roasted Brussels sprouts. zero caramelization sprouts underdone woody steamed totally changing flavor also pretty much no seasoning. Lastly creme brûlée dessert. sugar crust done correctly but it. custard clotted consistency ricotta cheese super unappetizing. All all kind staff beautifully decorated restaurant cannot lack care food. best mediocre meal worthy steakhouse title prices. Best crab cake Vegas far!!! Happened ladies happy hour super cheap drinks did raffle giving away free nights Plaza bottles wine Oscars. Even DeNiro impersonator entertaining crowd. Must go! ordered bone ribeye perfectly cooked medium rare literally melted your mouth. service impeccable onion bread die come table steaming hot. veteran disability save three  months able but believe folks well well worth starting save again another 3 months back want try prime rib. disappointed writing bad review but truly believe being honest genuine experiences. visited Oscar's Saturday night part group 10 celebrate grandmother's 70th bday. all flown Cali looked forward eating Oscar's. Brad funny host but did nothing save evening plate plate plate ice cold food. Yes $40 $65 $90 steaks came table COLD. Imagine cold meat accompanied lukewarm mashed potatoes room temp creamed spinach. Even when plates returned food still cool never hot.

While Brad tried compensate he ended frustrated short tempered literally EVERY meal steak + sides sent back except one. Eventually manager came over while took off half items never apologized explained WHY cooks couldn't right. Don't visit group you'll super disappointed hungry!! Oscar's experience. ambience great looking Fremont lights on. Food fantastic. crab cakes world. Prime Rib could any better. However service. waiter Vegas 35 years old time service style exceptional. Living Vegas forever gets jaded. Oscar's reality. Its great!!!!! Oh forgot. Yes waiter did take best photos phone send them you. Oscar's Vegas baby. Old time Vegas. Best prime rib ever. chopped salad amazing potatoes au gratin wonderful. Staff incredibly friendly knowledgeable helpful view Fremont street fantastic. love respect Mayor Goodman but when comes steak all better. 

I only heard good review guy named David Sadjak lives motto A free meal always tastes better .

He loves Bucca Di Pepo every second rate buffet town gives free half priced food case someone else buying.

I see myself. only sum way On Anthony Bourdain's programs he always tastes food then raves good is. If he nothing good say he just doesn't say it. He talked Mayor Goodman old days Las Vegas did say thing food.

Since can't say anything nice respect Mayor Goodman service City simply say anything. Steak shtick  COURSE check place out!!!

I HUGE fan old steakhouse used location unpretentious very reasonably priced steakhouse fare. Then replaced poseur ass tapas joint which thankfully didn't last...and now back being steakhouse although bit more expensive old steakhouse.

I'm guessing new higher prices subsidize cost having Broads payroll  sexy women fake Marilyn Monroe costumes sashay around room table table telling all Vegas. main reason  wanted see Broads all case ever need new job!

I pretty much expected strip club aggressive Broads forcing themselves trying buy them drink buy them dinner pay law school tuition stripper speak coke pills . But wasn't way all! 

The night Friday only solitary Broad working room...and she very easygoing. She stopped table few times chat sat down once...but even when friend offered buy dinner she said she busy working room! loss  friend those guys gives $100 bills any bimbo comes down pike she could made some cash off easy! credit though she didn't pander. Nice! 

Foodwise average steakhouse fare  no better no worse any other steakhouse. caprese salad very good petit filet $32 good loaded baked potato. Bottle wine cocktails sheesecake dessert. only real bummer bar did stock B B which ordered dinner drinks. waiter said Benedictine which could just mix brandy B B...but man tasted ass! think Benedictine BENADRYL something! Bleccchhh!

The service ok  never did bread basket table never crumbed anything. But hoity toity restaurant  shtick! Oscar Goodman memorabilia all over walls Broads cheeseball gowns feather boas poor waiters cheap looking pinstriped Mobster shirts ties....it's more Disneyland fine dining.

Which fine me! friend made day  first hit Mob museum then took leisurely stroll down Fremont St dinner here. very shticky day!

My complaint decor ambiance weirdly lacking. through all trouble hire Broads live piano player lounge basically re create old time swanky Vegas steakhouse...and then furnished looks leftovers 1998 cruise ship! Boring uninspired drab  boo!! some really cool retro vintage swank? Right now lounge area isn't even cool enough bother stopping drink You'd more atmosphere Holiday Inn!

Step Oscar! wife dined Oscar's several times now honestly tell never left disappointed. just every high end steakhouse las vegas live Oscar's opinion simply best ever had. just time great visit but very consistent every time think cannot better actually exceeds expectations. prepared fine dining restaurant pay but pay leave feeling very well satisfied. Well worth opinion. really wanted love place because love Oscar Goodman . But only give 3 1 2 stars. food OK maybe another city would best resturuant town....but Vegas many outstanding steakhouses Oscar's seems mediocre comparison. dinning companion both ordered same thing crab cake appetizer NY strip steak lobster tail. crab cakes good steak. But most high end steakhouses Vegas steaks come perfectly seasoned where don't need put anything all....that case Oscars you definitely need salt pepper shaker entree . also steaks topped mushrooms. mushrooms good but sautéed little dry lacked some seasoning. lobster tail slight unusual flavor....it hard describe....but would say hint woody nutty flavor it. location decor ate main dinning room overlooking Fremont street way anyone fan movie Casino recognize place immediately resturuants Robert De Niro character big fight wife at . resturant's view good used large two story platform built end Fremont Street which blocks good portion resturant's view Fremont street I am sure if structure permanent temporary but definitely view blocking eye sore . interior decor nice but nothing exceptional certainly no where near elegant some high end resturuants strip . But does old world Vegas charm may find appealing. Overall decent resturuant but many better steakhouse resturuants Vegas in same price range Oscar's would top choice. Best dirty martini vegas love spot. Streak Perfect service awesome too. Food amazing! Filet Mignon Mac Cheese. Waitstaff very knowledgeable friendly. Prices very high though. needed longer review vs tip but really only thing need say is FANTASTIC! 
ASK ROBERT aka BOBBY! Oscar's before seeing show Smith Center. Ambience excellent. during day but imagine must breathtaking night. Very friendly service. Prompt. Onion bread great. going lie expensive. But also upper class place. jeans nice shirt no worries. casual dress code. terrific meal 12oz filet mignon lobster mac n cheese asparagus two White Russians. Bill $110 which includes 20% gratuity. If you're lovely night great food then highly recommend Oscar's. tried many items menu let tell nowhere Las Vegas does better! must eat affordable Steakhouse prime location Las Vegas History. named former mayor criminal defense attorney mob Oscar Goodman.

Obscenely obvious did want wait wife I! more class blow your name but your name know never recommend Oscars because you. Outstanding service quality food! waitress Tasha remarkably personable made expert recommendations ensure just right amount food. 5 6 meals cooked perfection additional meal quickly remedied enjoyed. onion bread served before meal which party could eat due allergy. staff quickly found alternative very accomodating. enjoyed meal further enhanced spectacular view Freemont Street. Well thought price payed would've treated VIP's but guess just another set tourists them.

This place HIGHLY recommend. Great food!! crab cakes steak Oscar comes topped even more crab. service excellent! Overall great dining experience Ok review highly overdue because Coming quite some time.  Now first time came early dinner before show Smith Center .  service impeccable food great but broads well terrible . next time came happy hour say prettier bars Las Vegas definitely worth trip . Then started coming before Smith Center event dear friend mine seems made acquaintances executive chef.  wonderful place if haven't dining room Plaza Hotel where pool used years years years ago. interesting location which great view prior slotzilla being built.  Shall talk food? Yes lets! First all wonderful birthday dinner tonight let tell barbecue shrimp crab cakes . Just eat them. They're amazing . crabcake exactly would want crab little veg no filler.  barbecue shrimp beyond words. most salads Caesar salad wedge salad chopped salad. chopped salad favorite but they're all good.  friends ordered Tomahawk twice buttery salty delicious. Weird way describe steak but  literally tastes like.  Although think tourist would love spot much anyone else strongly believe locals should support place . Oscars!!!! Friday April 7 2017 brought friend father dinner great time. waiter Robert great! He kept laughing made dining experience memorable. wasn't sure going dinner. Therefore asked Robert if he surprise dinner. He brought rib eye steak. dinner complemented waiter's hospitality. plan coming again. asked if he take picture phone since photo wasn't all he took phone picture uploaded . He texted picture. Robert great! favorite place downtown Vegas. Crab stuffed jumbo shrimp.....Omg 4 $28. Worth it. Can't wait taste them again when come backski. Food good great waiter good humor. But lot small mistakes rest staff prevent them 4 stars could had. Service attentive arrival but felt rushed through meal. Tried clear appetizer before finished. Main course arrived but food served luke warm best. Sent back 2 sides main dish. GM seemed concerned when happened tried right but night already ruined. Food good flavor seasoned nicely. experiencing issues service slow return table. GM sent birthday dessert table part recovery but noticed other tables celebrating also received same desserts. recovery attempt fail. special birthday celebration expecting. Fantastic atmosphere dinner drinks. server Lenore exceptional. Professional knowledgeable warm hearted recommending Corn Brulee which fantastic. She gave just right amount space while maintaining excellent service. Thank Lenore!! recently signed IndiCard App service industry workers receive discount restaurants. husband saw Oscar's 20% off offer wanted give them try. walked Tuesday night no reservation seated promptly center most table facing down Fremont st. impressed ambiance view both super excited dine expecting nothing but exceptional dining experience. Boy... looks deceiving. waitress approached table immediately told IndiCard discount because know server know discounts ahead time. She wasn't familiar card which understood because new well said she needed ask manager which fine. 7 min later well dressed man assumed manager approached noticed only still water asked if ready order told entire order... old fashioned fruity cocktail filet mignon medium rare Oscar style 3 sides Brussels sprouts creamed corn onion strings. drinks arrived ok old fashioned kinda syrupy. food arrived all three side filet mignon but Oscar styled. informed food runner missing he find server. waited cut into filet which burnt outside blue inside. husband both felt tasted whopper meat Burger King charred. sever returned tell Oscar style its way told filet tasted burnt. She took new made left creamed corn Brussels sprout onion straw sides left table ate those. Another 10 15 min finished sides without being checked server manager took order. then realized while all show ok drinks bread side dishes now gone cold no steak apology long all taking. decided first time
In service industry life grab husband leave without paying anything. would normally tip because sometimes isn't servers fault but believe all around bad experience every person interacted with. walked right manager took order told severely disappointed service just wanted leave did. sad such wonderful ambiance dining room screams should great dining experience but unfortunately never back again... discount not. expecting bit more experience going Oscar's. paying premium price most items menu but falls bit short mark. used nice view Fremont Street but since erection zip line structure really can't see anything except Main Street intersection. lot ambiance lost.

While service very good food simply average. wife liked salmon very much but thought prime rib simply okay. meal tab over $100 could done better elsewhere. Amazing restaurant bar. When walk forget ghetto part town. decorations furniture ambience top notch. Steve bartender very helpful telling happy hour specials. ordered crabcakes beef sliders delicious. Then Steve gave helpful information other bars hit area. Thank steve! Every time Las Vegas stopping Oscar's now on. Disappointed. Waited long time come here. Guess when you're yourself don't rate any kind decent service. Oh well steak good but ordered medium  raw. didn't even ask anything was. upscale steakhouse decent happy hour. came large group work. luckily came early enough seated all area bar really crowded quickly opening. decided part group dinner. 
We fairly decent waiter. steaks average but didn't quite live price tag. would recommend visit if neighborhood but many other great steakhouses Vegas. friend took Birthday dinner.  food amazing.  travel each week work eat all time.  takes lot impress me.  crab cakes beef tar tar appetizers.  Both outstanding.  Dinner bone ribeye.  most flavorful tender piece meat ever had!  service impeccable.  new favorite restaurant!  views Freemont Street awesome!  Highly recommended! really don't think steakhouse anything write home about. really mediocre best. filet cut sub par wouldn't even call USDA choice cut. noticed menu only few cuts labeled distinctly Prime. leads strong hunch meats just regular USDA cuts most likely aged anything sorts.

As sides ok quite frankly better mashed potatoes creamed spinach. just wasn't really much tried. 

The positive place would view. nice view Fremont street which really cool I'd say. Other better experiences numerous other steakhouses. Gave spot try while staying plaza during Vegas visit. When purchasing show tickets tix4tonight mentioned staying plaza girl helping offered reservation even offered coupon meal. $6 bought 30% off entire bill. 

The view does disappoint being end Freemont St entire roof glass dome giving beautiful view downtown. staff adds elegance restaurant pleased different options menu offers. roasted chicken artichokes boyfriend filet. food good but lacked little flavor however onion strings delicious side dishes definitely portioned sharing. 

With coupon saved $22.. shabby! Beautiful setting ambiance.  Service excellent.  N.Y. steak very good but slightly tough side.  worth $48.  Creamed corn Caesar salad very tasty.  Four medium sized shrimp appetizer very overpriced $18.  Calamari nothing rave about.  Wine selection glass very limited.  Undecided if return. Stopped happy hour lovely time. Enjoyed some shrimp cocktail crab cakes ALL lump crab giant meatballs amazing ricotta cheese. 

Prices extremely nice great view no matter where sit venue. 

Will back dinner but really enjoyed happy hour here! Highly recommended if you're downtown LV! Great filet mignon dinner! Made reservation Open table even though wasn't very busy pretty late Saturday night. nice table window started refreshing cocktail. When couldn't choose between couple options appetizer waiter suggested calamari which very good. both large filet mignon which excellent... seared lovely crust. Enjoyed spinach side bread plenty dinner skipped  dessert. Overall very convenient nice steakhouse if you're downtown area. dinner Oscar's last Halloween only food service great but wonderful view Fremont Street all Halloween. Definitely place visit if old section town looking very good meal accompanying view. Two stars skirt steak which amazing. However server very rude. guess where ordering much he felt should ASSUMING tip would small also. 50th birthday which mentioned reservation but mentioned acted on. Mr Grey Ponytail waiter hope enjoyed tip didn't deserve my friend saint wonderful dinner last night.  food excellent filet tender chunks crab meat stuffed shrimp instead ground stuff.  Beautiful spacious dining room dome ceiling terrific view Freemont Street light show. Reasonably priced menu. again.  isn't chain restaurant!! Omg place new all time favorite Mac cheese sweet potato chil sweeet sauce . crab legs die along chicken artichoke 100 perfect.. First time having dinner here. stopped happy hour but never dinner. Tried since restaurant week disappointed. same thing Caesar salad filet cheesecake. Bobby server he awesome. Very personable without pretentiousness. Hate when server fake nice Bobby just good guy. Food really good. Salad typical salad but steak tender almost didn't need knife. tasty cooked perfectly. Came mashed potatoes which also good asparagus. Asparagus huge little big just ate tops. Cheesecake delicious came side berries. Great night definitely back ask Bobby! Service excellent but food not.  Weiner Schnitzel served red cabbage changing taste entirely ruining.  ordered surf turf filet rare.  arrived medium medium rare.  sorbet tiramasu very good dessert choice.  Lastly espresso tasted Senca instant. Great find downtown Vegas. running late but phone call promised save table. Staff beyond professional courtesy. food large portions cooked your request want throw there. wedding anniversary brought nice plate chocolate covered strawberries anniversary plate. Big bonus former current mayor well owner restaurant sat next us. just visited Oscar's 2nd time. 1st time such memorable experience birthday felt spoilt food presentation service amazing cheesecake dessert candle Happy Birthday written beautifully plate. Vegas locals husband decided going Oscar's birthday tradition enjoyed experience much! returned 2nd time high expectations. husband made reservations week prior made note birthday which he reminded hostess when he checked in. enjoyed Happy Hour bar before seated felt although service still good rushed through dinner food presentation sloppy. disappointed hadn't communicated server birthday left no birthday surprise. late then anywhere else. never blow candle birthday wish probably won't return Oscar's again. restaurant 'special occasion' type place splurge if aren't going feel special then take money somewhere else. am probably best reviewer never made past bar.
Nonetheless great time.
My dirty vodka martini perfect thanks Rocky! crab cakes HH menu made perfect meal me. date loved meatballs. 
They ran Pinot Noir...a little odd but deal breaker another martini!

We sure return. Overall nice place steaks atmosphere.  apps okay exception Ahi which bit bland.  steaks cooked perfection but once again could used little more spice.  service started great but then slipped near end.  should never waiters bring your main course while still working apps salads restaurant caliber.  good but Andiamo better. Such shame. We're local eaten 10 12 times always good  but tonight. Service indifferent best. Wedge salad just ok. did divide two. Steaks served cool touch. Potatoes cool butter would melt. Waiter took steak potato. Steak returned dry. New potato brought warmer. Sent steak back but decided eat potato. However disgruntled waiter took fork could eat potato. gave left never return. Oscar should ashamed. Horrible waiter frank made feel uncomfortable comments. He obviously drunk embarrassed trying pretty girls take pics. Creepy! never return Loved atmosphere. Loved food. prime rib AMAZING. Also crab stuffed shrimp yummy too. place looks beautiful end Fremont street. Come dusk watch lights turn see people crowd outside. highly recommend place. Food service atmosphere all aces! little late review but better late never.  we're New Year's Day Dinner.  Yes others mentioned hidden gem.

We vegetarian group which Chef server more accommodating. First time dine here. Everything perfection! Tenderloin blue cheese crumbles atop! just crumbles but huge chunks blue cheese. Caesar salad best years just right amount anchovy flavors dressing. definitely eat again Okay early but time change CST Pacific no lunch famished.

We sat window overlooking Fremont street where local freak flags flying high!

Ordered Cesar salad adequate but great. 

One broads came by. Classically dressed 60's she boring. hoping she'd fun full history witty things but instead talking card board box.  Oh well no big deal.

Ordered prime rib. Medium rare. $64 supposed best town. came well done. Such shame waste beautiful steak. sent back. came back raw. knew better send back third time ate cooked left giant bloody flesh pot middle plate.

We vacated quickly could. Oscars may great time but seems spiraling drain now. Great Wednesday happy hour. Good all night. Food good. only prime steak NY. Gotten window view all worth even though waited more half hour food. would leave same review if no window seat available since quality food so. If you're downtown best steakhouse you're gonna find. Marylin does all brunt work runs circles around everybody. should change name Marylin's. little bit more fan but just under 5 star rating.   Wife entertaining family back east.   heard Oscar's travel magazine decided give try.   

Loved it.  service excellent.   cheerfully greeted hostess desk.   having reservation okay.   seated cocktail lounge while waited table.   promptly served Manhattans.   Drinks expect classic steak house.   Good but over top LA get.   Bar staff excellent.

Our table became quickly available.   bar staff excellent handle progress dining table offering information without being asked.  waiter awesome.  steaks 5 stars.   Great pieces beef.   table ordered prime rib filets.  All excellent par other great steak houses experienced LA NYC Kansas City Chicago.   

We'll back.  Great meal memory. Fantastic restaurant. homage old Vegas. Classy without being stuffy. Reasonably priced huge portions delicious menu options. wonderful hidden gem! no idea place existed. whole ambience place great. sat bar where bartender Steve took care us. He very friendly attentive. drinks never empty. Larry Liso singing he amazing! definitely made atmosphere even better. He sang Sinatra Elvis more. ordered delicious chopped salad. friend ordered steak which he said perfect. would definitely recommend place tourists locals! yourself favor.  Come down west end Fremont Street where Old Vegas lives yourself great meal Oscar's.

You know great?  whole deal  what.  food.  enjoyed surf turf couple times. atmosphere location. feels old school...in good way.

But most all service. Again yourself favor ask Bobby when reservation. Tell Wyatt's sent you.  won't sorry.  

Oscar's more importantly...Bobby become go to experiences when Vegas.

Hit 'em steak. limb say Plaza 2 best restaurants Fremont Experience.  them.  If you're feeling cleaning yourself bit enjoying very nice atmosphere well decorated steakhouse then you'll fine Oscar's.  Only Vegas could away sign says Booze Beef Broads !  wish could remember bartender served dinner.  He polite fun talk efficient professional.  He fit atmosphere classy place perfectly.  cut steak literally infused garlic lightly seasoned peppers. wish could remember name steak..I'm forgetting everything!  
One thing won't forget letting know you'll exciting dining experience if 2nd floor stop Oscar's.  There's even piano but no playing while there. Oh...The Caesar Salad wasn't really anything special even though hint anchovies dressing bordered bland.  mashed potatoes bit runny.  sure intentionally served them way but consistency wasn't really liking.  flavorful though. 

Even if miss Happy Hour won't mind spending bit more wonderful service atmosphere great steaks.  probably come every other time Vegas...That's because cheap skate! found Oscars Goodfellas documentary. Once found some scenes shot on!
We showed Thursday which ladies night. Bellini all drinks lol wife free Corona.

We ordered sliders crab cakes meatballs which all discounted happy hour.
The Sliders amazing some sort marinade teriyaki taste them. 
my wife crab cakes said best she meatballs fluffy filling!

We hoping meet Oscar but told he only shows early week. bartender friendly inviting. place upscale almost seems place Plaza Casino Hotel.

Thanks Oscars we'll see again June! steakhouse now all old lady Vegas wrapped into perfectly cooked steak. waiter Scott fantastic. He refused order but diverted making poor good decision. Scott bartender Rick reason enough come back anytime town. Thank delicious steaks thank Scott excellent service. Just came history. Overall ordinary. Yelp! noted 50% Happy Hour apps...which honored because seated dining room which kinda weak I didn't ask since mentioned yelp note . Wedge salad good maybe little heavy dressing. Mob meatball nothing special. House Pinot good. Nothing bad just nothing really good. Welcome Oscar's. arrived early checked then bar beverage. Bar tender friendly responsive great recommendations craft cocktails. When party finally all together contacted hostess promptly seated. several large parties little loud. drink orders taken exactly promptly brought. waitress Lenore bus person Maria. may sound trite but when asking diet coke most places ask if Diet Pepsi okay. Oscar's did ask some party care Diet Pepsi. should specify. or Not?? . Menu piece paper cardboard backing. Finally drinks arrive. did order wine because waitstaff never returned said deciding wine. Once did return just decided order main courses.
Our orders Manny's stuffed shrimp. Shrimp over cooked tough even cut. flavor lacked seasoning. Josie ordered Prime Rib medium  Caesar Salad Salad bland did capers but probably taste salad but many way anymore. Prime Rib more rare medium tough lacked favor well. also ordered Prime Rib Mid Rare which came more rare I mostly okay that . Blue Cheese wedge. Bleu . Could used more dressing but cheese crumbles sufficient. Also wedge old fashioned wedge broken four parts plate. other guests 8oz Filet more 4oz . cooked correctly good flavor but lacked few ounces. Cedar Planked Blackened Salmon Cooked little more done guest liked however flavor good. Wonder if strong seasoning covers lack great cook fish. three sides $20. Steamed Asparagus salted but seamed thought cooked flavor cooking 101 . no real flavor however properly cooked. Smashed Potatoes Warm around edges cold middle bland taste. Finally Potatoes Au Gratin sure really was. seamed half shredded potatoes whole. white cheese top Smashed cold middle. potatoes also funky flavor texture unable explain. point Manger we assume stop ask things were. responded Okay . No real response she rambled some touristy rambling seat location. sure interaction was Awkward uncomfortable . side dishes told share size imagined family style big plate. Each except Asparagus more decent size side dish. 
Since Birthday brought piece Cheesecake candle. Cheesecake tasted defrosted recently freezer burn taste once thawed. candle may tasted better.
For most part wait staff attentive drinks kept filled. 
We great expectations half party before said quite different. rule just simple blue collar people save meal beyond normal budget. Sometimes meals worth expense however not. No photos nothing stood wow factor. Maybe cook staff focused big parties just took back seat good food. 
Goodbye Thank coming. did Exit farewell staff. We may left wrong door maybe . say back. hype good reality. No Broads...I thought some showgirls something. recommend going unless over priced bland over under cooked freezer burnt food. guess should read other reviews before going? made dinner reservations Christmas. called before 5 PM left message directed voicemail name number date time reservation many contact number. open 5PM expected call back 5 30 PM Not! called back 6 15PM language barrier person took reservation set.
We arrived 4 40 PM 5 00 Reservation directed bar wait unit could seated. Drinks well made but little pricey even most restaurant standards. seated little 5 found decor table arrangements pleasing. If ask table overlooking Freemont Street.
Our Waitress pleasant friendly when she came over offered wine list which declined. ordered several appetizer's Ceaser Salad. While waited ordered Iced tea water delivered reasonable time. Crab Cakes good Tomato Mozzarella platter. Salad drenched dressing unable eat sent back. Waitress claims she spoke Manager took off check I cover later . appetizers served cold bread basket no butter. 5 minutes Bus Person came back butter reaching over Mothers head dropped middle table. other reviews said bread cold butter actually bland no taste.
Our Waitress came over let know she going place meal orders would 15 minutes so.  fine no hurry. During time ask water refills Iced Tea. seems everyone just walked around but paid no attention tables? While sitting Bus Person reached over took Wife's bread plate off table no apparent reason. wife dirty knife Tomato Salad when she tried give she told keep reuse it.
During wait Hostesses making rounds stopped table wife mentioned her. She brought new plate knife her. table ignored Managers walked around Hostess though did visit two tables long periods time I guess High Rollers .
Our waitress checked back told 5 7 minutes dinner. waited 12 but Good Food takes time. If good food would minded. 6 oz Steak perfect inside medium rare but no taste all. wife's Prime Rib dry no offer any Au jus Sauce moisten up. Mothers Salmon over done burnt outside. side dishes ok nothing special just ok. None finished dinners did request pack them up. signs good Managers look when customers still tables .
We declined dessert obvious reasons Waitress gave option returning check did want wait 5 10 minutes. asked right away did sit think experience. She disappeared 6 7 minutes came back dropped final check no listing could tell if Salad removed. she come back someone else close would asked itemized bill. also did ask ID Credit Card which signed back reason.
For small place many Servers Bus Persons etc attention detail minimal. Everyone runs around but seems nothing gets done. high hopes return destination friends family but going happen.
If delight venue view Freemont Street maybe appetizer two leave. Wife visited 5 30pm Tuesday. Headed into bar drinks apps. Initial impression positive big space comfortable seating. Then 10+ minute wait server approach us. Then only asked hosts if table service told waitress visiting patrons seated bar server. Tasha learned name came serve only being approached host. She took drink order drinks delivered another 10+ minutes later manager without requested garnish blue cheese olives no napkin. while later Tasha reappeared asked drinks which responded no garnish no napkin no recognition bad service Tasha. She asked appetizer order said changed mind large part based bad service also because 4 5 offerings seafood no beef based app steak house! . 

Tasha comped drinks. left rival Andiamos steakhouse D. Spent $100 drinks appetizers delicious service excellent!  Oscars needs act together service standard. Amazing!! locals took friends show Scintas fabulous old school show ! Everything fantastic...the food service view!

Lamb chops horrible.  Filet so so stuffed shrimp.  Wouldn't back. Whoa baby! place phenomenal! Service David impeccable! Seafood great! Shrimp sight! Skirt steak....delicious! Sides great...creamed spinach TRUFFLE MASHED....OMG! Ate everything plates. No room dessert! Broads fun idea. Wine list terrific. Go! Worth every penny! Views romantic....... took tired cranky pal directly airport Oscar's search some red meat drinks soothe weary bones. showed around 5 00pm Friday evening caught Happy Hour bar. there's bunch drink appetizer specials plus each free glass wine checking Yelp. comfy barstools lots room spread eat convenient purse hooks under every seat. only ding ambiance bar SUPER loud and only louder halfway into meal could barely talk friend without SCREAMING her. service wise Steve gem. not mention fine helllll. hey boo hey. the food delicious. beef carpaccio. which special $9 usually $17. next time order sans capers but beef mustard aoili both delicious. also burrata heirloom tomato salad microgreens which killer. friend spicy flank steak which insane. may next time. if you're type person excited finding whole cloves spicy garlic hiding your steak dish you.

if you're staying downtown craving steak Oscar's extremely solid choice. but i'd stick Happy Hour if you're looking spend $$$$. only reason withholding 5th star loudness music stereo system. nobody wants screaming dinner companion 5 00pm yo. relaxed server place vibe restaurant very very appealing. memorabilia Oscar sport teams comics really made atmosphere. most delicious wine I'm still searching merlot! appetizers shrimp the biggest shrimp ever seen spicy cocktail sauce superb...chicken meatballs? sure chicken? much flavor! Bread table scrumptious....my guest ordered pork chops looked good he cringed paying over $30 pork chops lol but  Vegas steakhouse ya..! prime rib good but amazing a tad disappointing. tender lacking heavy spice edges. just anticipating best prime rib ever...but keep searching. sides au gratin potatoes very cheesy made super yummy leftover late night snack. Dessert cheesecake also just okay prefer denser cheesecake tangy ness. But recommend place view Fremont. would try again order something different entrée. wonderful time together again waiter cool. Very good. steak just perfect Brussels sprouts. wife chicken w steamed vegetables. Server good friendly.. nice viewpoint old strip. Took husband anniversary dinner think tradition. sweet potato fried OMG!! good ambiance point view over Freemont really feel your High Class joint ARE!!! Food mediocre best service completely horrible. Dined 8 16 2015 Scott server utterly rude. did enjoy skirt steak ever undercooked rare extremely tough. understandable but Scotts attitude unacceptable he acted though personally insulted even though told sorry say anything. never returning. wonderful time admiring view chowing down delicious steak.  Motown singer great. Spacing tables made intimate dinner fun people watching. Prime Rib Superb. Thick juicy perfect med. rare but lacked Thyme Rosemary flavor. au jus bit bland but horseradish cream sauce very good. 
Caesar Salad Excellent 
Filet Minion Delicious. 

There three reasons am giving 5 stars 1 wine selection way overpriced. $50 bottle Chateau St. Michelle WA? don't think so...
Simple common economics shows if reasonably price goods consumers purchase more goods overall. would purchased bottle $37 giving $17 dollar profit but instead didn't purchase anything because overpriced. 


2 Again wine... No Chianti? Really..? C'mon. 

3 hispanic lady bussing table 3 4 5 30 pm overly aggressive bored. She kept interrupting conversation every five minutes asking if wanted more water. 
NO. millionth time! 
Then she tried taking plates before finished. 
We trying enjoy dinner nice view. 
Just because weren't shoveling food mouth holes ravenous beasts didn't mean finished. She wouldn't leave alone!!! She kept reaching across table taking plates off asking hand things.. Hand fork please cannot reach it. if wait until leave reach all want! 
Jeepers Crymany! 

Nice waiter nice atmosphere good food. food good liked round building all windows. Unfortunately zero ambiance. music Rick Astley really? loud impossible normal conversation everyone trying talk over ridiculously loud music made even louder. steakhouse experience hoping price point. group ten came Saturday birthday dinner. Half party early sat bar area drink. tag line is Beef booze broads. all three. beef decent. steak tartare New York strip. tartare better two. chopped salad peppercorn dressing better caesar well. tend trend most items menu. If ordered two items crowd favorite. special note jumbo lump crab cakes. spectacular. separation meat impressive. predominantly crab. If want try more side option pick any three $15 small savings. portions big easy share. jumbo baked potato corn brulee sweet potato wedges. sweet potato favorite. came honey jalapeno dipping sauce. would definitely order again if back.

As booze bartenders good. better Manhattans but nothing frown upon. friend tried cable car first time enjoyed it. specialty drinks all tailor towards sweet cocktail drinkers.

The broads present well. being sat saw girl gown large head dress walking around. Near end she asked if everything liking. 

If downtown want travel then good option. Just lovely restaurant excellent service food just wonderful. pricey would normally come more special occasion special date night because price but more casual vibe. definitely would recommend early dinner if possible. only down side used great view Fremont street experience now view end zip line  kind disappointing but worst Excellent steakhouse inside rough around edges Plaza hotel casino downtown Vegas. Take elevator escalator 2nd floor enter attractive open air domed Oscars. really nice time but think its very overpriced considering location. Started decent cocktails....should $17 each Manhattan Old Fashioned . Wife glass pinot. son really liked corn crab bisque....wife split Caesar salad..good great. NY Strip $48 ..it very good. Wife blackened Salmon..she said tender tasty. son bone ribeye $64! . ordered medium..looked medium rare but he loved it. mashed potatoes creamed spinach typical but good. should try deep dish Chocolate Chip Cookie dessert. Insanely good enough three. liked server named Scott. personable..efficient.. just you'd expect high end place this. very impressed free valet service fro Smith Center. really nice perk! actually waiting shows end. feel bit elitist when comes steakhouses  there's plenty great ones NYC other places lived traveled  but meal Oscar's easily best steakhouse dinners ever had. Great steak cooked wonderfully. Delicious sides try Corn Brulee recommended fantastic server clearly did lead astray. Great food great service great atmosphere... already want back! Overall service just really amazing here! Very elegant lovely restaurant dine two. Ask if sit window! crab cake tomato salad really good. 12 oz filet mignon very juicy tender. Also side steamed asparagus Ralph's smashed potatoes. Definitely come back! Thanks Jennifer excellent waitres  very professional pretty. Everything delicious except onion soup! Recommend anyone!!!! Wonderful decor ambiance beautiful view excellent service great food. highly recommend if you're looking classy night out. steak house located dome Plaza Hotel across street Freemont. 

The location place could better. over look Freemont night when lights come amazing

Let's talk food!
I ordered salad appetizer. absolutely amazing. Blue cheese bacon really made amazing. 

For entree ordered Spilotro Steak. stuffed garlic topped red chili flakes. STEAK INCREDIBLE. juicy flavorful. 
The service top notch well. workers named Amy terrible she's rude no respect manners she place look very bad. sure if because extra hungry food really good but no complaints. popped without reservation looked busy time. let order bar. roasted chicken seared tuna some friends meatballs. All delicious. star amazing view another honoring reservation request table right window front Fremont Street Experience.  would add another great company but wouldn't really review reflection restaurant p

The whole experience rather meh. server slow did appreciate upselling.  food better steak bread sides just every other steakhouse to.  each ordered filet mignon shared sides creamed spinach corn brulee garlic potato wedges.  complimentary bread onion bread which personally wasn't crazy about.  liked garlic potato wedges best which basically just tasted cut baked potato.  Btw ran prime rib over hour before closing which dining companions set ordering rather disappointing.  cherry top loud drunk guys table next making some sort comments Asian people.  How's ambience? If anything come view but know better food service elsewhere. Meh. food good but service so.  broads sweet entertaining. came Friday. dinner started hostess hustling bigger tip window seat reserved. place half full plenty windows available. waiter borderline rude annoyed because friends town late getting lost. would if place packed needed turnover tables. busser brought dessert before ordered did understand English when tried say didn't order it. Isn't basic English necessary perform job duties? would hate dessert sitting front someone else. Yuck. food mediocre. skirt steak which huge cloves garlic embedded somehow. liked alright. potatoes ice cold. Husband filet. Said OK. Friends said prime rib fish great. But neither ate more few bites. think food service ridiculously overpriced. $196 before tip 4 dinners no wine. Sorry Oscar think need new management. don't see place lasting long. caliber Fremont street people won't spend locals won't return. usual would preferrred Outback.  rather sad. Return? NO WAY! food service ambiance excellent.  very dissapointed view. huge wall blocking view dinner walked down its actually stage performers . waiter outstanding never empty glass. ordered filet husband ordered Oscar's cut prime rib both medium rare.  husband did send back 1st very dry tough. But waiter replaced immediately 2nd 100% better. Excellent food service every time! Most time am allowed off menu Porterhouse which fantastic! seen Hizzoner many times he always outgoing cordial. try best Ignacio waiter each time he such wonderful compliment night Oscar's. sure enjoy lounge before dinner always pleasure! Pugh Fugit IT!!!

Don't let location detour you! 

I three appetizers crab cakes fried calamari shrimp cocktail. All beautifully plated deliciously flavored fresh. 

I would given five stars but little disappointed wine selection. just difficult wino. Lol. Jk. Best happy hour Vegas! 
The best corn chowder crab love ambience. dinner couple times having prime rib crab legs spinach soufflé all good.i Oscars just every time Vegas. never disappoints! If you're looking old Vegas dining experience then oscars place go. came large group people called ahead reservations  highly recommended. sat window overlooking Fremont Experience which perfect view. each ordered steak did shareable sides. Everything delicious service exceptionally good. Good food steaks but music loud could hear each other speak.  live entertainer but super super loud.  seemed odd high end restaurant music loud. LOVE place! restaurant pretty views Freemont Street every table. booth spacious comfy. food delicious. asparagus spears baked potato largest ever saw life! cocktails perfect large glasses wine. service very attentive. Ami the broad very nice knowledgable. jazz trio bar sounded great. bar decor very tastefully decorated. people lost cell phone booth back next day. knew belonged reservation. all very impressed Oscar's. classy yet affordable place. We'll definitely back! great location too! Oooooooooh Emmmmmmm Geeeeeeeee! food incredible!! Crab cakes must! filled huge lumps crab lightly fried tomato dipping sauce mustard perfect pairing. special night Mahi Mahi w Crab asparagus bearnaise sauce. Simply put AMAZING. mahi mahi melted your mouth best! love atmosphere Old Vegas feel..Those dope times better superficial places lately. pretty pricey but worth experience. all food write good review!! Excellent food service.  onion bread serve start meal really good.  Warm fresh!  ordered caesar salad which thought excellent.  now authentic tasting you'd usually even came over pepper grinder.  fiancee said calamari he ordered best he ever had. I wouldn't try it dinner ordered filet mignon blue cheese topper baked potato bacon brussel sprouts.  filet divine!  Cooked perfection blue cheese just adds decadence. washed all down wine cocktail.  Everything wonderful.  Next time stay Plaza we'll sure return! wonderful restaurant experience. Good location view into Fremont Street ideal night. Excellent food. Even better main dishes side dishes. Best side dishes ever ate. cared large stuffed bear into dinner us. kind enough Teddy own chair table. Thanks great experience. four dinner hors d'oeuvres happy hour first which good priced right however main dining room looks dated needs remodeled. service good however menu pricey side dishes look frozen food section supermarket. small portions. ordered small fillet mignon which good but once again high side pricing somehow looked deserted big plate don't think would again probably try some other restaurants Fremont better value to date ambience Though previously dined Oscar's shortly grand opening while. strictly bar area during happy hour. 
Happy hour runs 4 7 pm though little vague ask actually included. told beer well drinks half off. no beer tap house margarita other person party some pondering Midori sour served straight up. Midori isn't well no happy hour pricing but bar tender didn't correct nor did he actually realize overheard co worker correct hushed voice later. 
 also ordered calimari which priced menu $8 incredibly reasonable nice steak house. portion enormous couldn't finish it. Sadly however totally lacked flavor seasoning just lots heavily breaded though thankfully well cooked over fried fare. 
 bill arrived two separate parts food drinks sort unusual. calimari actually cheaper listed menu guessing there's some sort mysterious happy hour pricing involved appetizers well. 
All all staff very attentive friendly three people checked decor nice view great but no special reason come back. would imagine back day could easily your 5 star restaurants Vegas.  However yourself favor before end era completely diminished all techno opulence glitz Vegas now become right down gin tonic become redbull vodka. 

It's shame place represents going fast if miss going you'll miss living experience might able find soon.  Even if just check memorabilia walls near restroom may crossing fingers hasn't gone era.

There history Vegas vibe certainly attitude down description website still place where broads roam Downtown Las Vegas restaurant hostesses adding glamorous uniquely Vegas style Oscar's. Yes certainly older legendary looking guy sure more stories old Vegas share roamed restaurant host.   waiting take picture but course he only talking good looking broad restaurant! Duh! And thorn side reminder reality era gone amazing Vegas view restaurant known somewhat covered stupid zip liner right front.  Sure colors ceiling look cool if only zip liner stage could just way! 

And attitude remember sometimes miss Vegas back day where would some gambling gin tonic smoke stuff really does stay Vegas description food well steakhouse served old legends would consider very good food. Rib Eye big serving plate potatoes finger licking scrumptious bread more buttered woman came with.  

What more review looking for? great experience moment walked treated royalty.  party 4 guests 3 different types steak ordered wow really know prepare steak.  east coast oysters great except 1 which case amazing server promptly replaced fresh pair perfect ones.  heavens Tasha Chanta couldn't more attentive busy Saturday night.  

Cody nice work leading great team.  hope never change servant leadership attitude take safely successfully top whatever ladder want climb.  very impressive see walk women safe place just perfect gentleman.  Cheers friends thanks some great pictures memories oh yeah Tasha thank bandaid sorry wine glass Very disappointing overall.   First good room atmosphere wonderful.  Very nice decor view looking straight down Fremont St all glass wall ceiling tough beat.  Bar area also very nice.

The problem food service.  Food tasted good however filet ordered medium rare came cool nowhere close hot.   larger issue someone table good amount sentiment bottom wine glass.  sure but size grass blades.   When pointed server he did nothing offered nothing even replacing glass.  

Finally while server friendly he far friendly.   socialize him.  He hung around table far long telling jokes sharing stories.  Some party did ask hiim some questions he wonderful answering.   He just didn't seem understand when enough enough.

We return. Above average steaks great sides great view downtown Las Vegas  phenomenal service.   large group came Oscar's waiter took care if small table focus attention.  service efficient unobtrusive.  However since such large group waiter suggested doing several appetizer plates side orders entire group.  

If large group dining Las Vegas can't better Oscar's! If you're fan Oscar Goodman you'll love place.  Traditional Las Vegas gourmet room fantastic service beautiful ambiance wonderful vibe.  However food best but nevertheless good quality preparation.  steak prime rib way go.  did care sides except Caesar's salad.  place live entertainment great bar nice bar menu wine list.  Overlooking Fremont Street Experience you'll delightful time here. Ok ok.. Oscars! must say probably best steaks ever had!! filet mignon Oscar style cooked perfectly very flavorful oscar style it's bernaisse sauce asparagus mushrooms think didn't over power flavor steak. Also French onion soup amazing French onion soup started love French onion soup.

The restaurant plaza overlooks freemont street experience you see view restaurant movie casino where Robert dinero Sharon stone having dinner . Great atmosphere very friendly wait staff. only thing didn't sense broads thing.. ladies walk around talk help give vibe old days guess don't know. great idea sure could executed well but broad very bland uninteresting somewhat awkward seemed she didn't know say something kind just asked everything waiter. If more substance oh where guys from? Then maybe some facts Vegas casino filmed being born raised Vegas would know all but mean just  something interesting. 

Overall Oscars great food atmosphere definitely would back filet soup! Hands down best steak ever eaten! feeling old Vegas. historical land mark many names restaurant but best representation Vegas fine dining name Oscars. wanting eat years. Spontaneously friend decided dine evening. called around 6 8 30 reservation very accommodating. best seat house view looking down Fremont street experience which partially blocked damn zip line . waiter pleasant knowledgable. ordered NY steak 14oz share sides Mac cheese mashed potatoes asparagus. appetizer bruschetta. complimentary bread serve delicious really could gone without bruschetta honest although delish. 

The steak best steak ever had. lot steaks. Medium rare just God intended steak be. Crispy outside tender juicy inside. seasonings perfect. Now am going steak dreams! ... your steak just succumb slogan BEEF BOOZE BROADS. then might meet famous lawyer keeper mob secrets Oscar Goodman himself. met tonight too. wow begining end great experience. Nick server pro every way. King Crab legs amazing spicy steak smashed potatoes cheesecake awesome capaccino. cool view vibe special old school Vegas night out. Robert Bobby best waiter. Cool restaurant lot LV history. took Bobby's recommendation steak ribeye killer. Indulged sorbet dessert. Oh lovely! classic ambiance downtown gem wonderful. loved service wine scenery steak creamed spinach corn stuffed crab shrimp baked potato. honest steak good but did surpass expectations. tasty but guess thought would amazing. Tasha server wonderful! She pleasant accommodating. end things met mayor Carolyn Goodman Oscar Goodman way out. restaurant however named him. Fun experience before watching Beauty Beast Smith Center. Please stop check Yelp complimentary wine! Nice looking place inside but when eating crab cakes pulled hair unfortunately already mouth before realized it.  Gross!  sure would recommend place someone liked.  Sorry Oscar's would good minus hair.  
I update review because bone ribeye dinner baked potato Brussels sprouts delicious steak cooked perfectly.  waitress fabulous manager made right comped meal.  believe hair crab cake random mishap common place.  Good job Oscar's! Met friend happy hour he wanted appetizer ordered Burrata.
It amazing would definitely again. Good Burrata art Chef down. reason 4 stars because although everyone else very nice bartender rude...acted he didn't want there. place amazing Let say walk into casino don't realize great restaurant right upstairs. Its art deco luxurious decor restaurant dress nicely take plenty pictures. bartenders super knowledgeable recommend arriving early having few bar before dinner. 

The food delicious perfectly seasoned. table four all ordered bone ribeye special. All perfectly cooked well rested before served. Everything perfect meal experience. waiter friendly.

My issue server told wrong price ribeye. He said 55.00pp charged 64.00pp. dinner party didn't realize until next day upset thus 3 stars. If wasn't major price difference would 4stars. highest score give. 

I still recommend place just sure double check bill. need preface review fact came when joint opened entertain Maui girlfriends review then 180 degrees experience. Channel 3's restaurant critic added Oscar's Valentines Day 2015 rec decided time give place another try.

Actually....it wayyyyy past time give another spin. wonderful turn around. Service stellar thanks Lenore. Server Lenore perfect balance decorum warmth. service made nice meal seem all more special always request future.The manager stopped table few times check us...which very nice touch much appreciated

A good bottle wine presented quickly evening flowed beautifully there. Crab cakes lovely generous size crab meat. Wedge salad crisp well dressed Maytag blue cheese. Carolyn's cut prime rib generous perfect medium rare. Giant baker great side share two...or more.

Impersonator Robert De Niro added some fun perfect evening can't wait bring some town friends  visit Bobby while enjoying ambiance great dinner wonderful old school Las Vegas vibe. Nicely done Oscar!

We back....... Great location downtown off Fremont Street but now apparatus zip lining blocks view activities. restaurant quite nice service very good. liked hearing live music lounge volume just right loud disrupt dinner conversation. Reason only three stars veal chop turned more 50% fat. Very little meat chop real disappointment. au gratin potatoes corn soufflé sides delicious plenty two people share. asparagus spears really large pretty much tasteless. would definitely come back Oscars again but would stick good steak. sister came Friday night.  seated great table awesome view dome towards Fremont Street.

Our server great.  Super friendly attentive but pushy.  She exactly love server.  bussers assistants made sure plates cleared quickly always water.

The food good. wasn't best steakhouse food ever life but wasn't bad either.  didn't any problems cook steak sides being cold anything.  think bit overpriced but don't really expect less Las Vegas place this.  

Overall great experience would definitely interested having again. If could would put less star. severely disappointed dinner here. While food really good wait staff completely ruined whole experience. could better service lower end restaurant. once did asked if would another drink both water glasses drink glasses completely empty half time here. Also every other table received basket bread before meal but did not. Then when sat 15 minutes empty plates finally brought bill. waited another ten minutes waiter come back close check he never did. literally find another waiter close bill out. never visit restaurant again highly recommend waste your money either. Way expensive think could better kind money watch every cost no price menu When Oscar's sure table dome area.  nice atmosphere really great view Fremont Street.

I started off bar area which happy hour every day including weekends.  really cool area bartenders great along drinks.

For dinner salmon filet which did disappoint.  Oddly enough standouts dinner dessert though.  layered chocolate mousse best ever had.

It's cheap but if looking really nice dinner downtown Vegas Oscar's won't disappoint. Great meal only few tables withe Fremont view reservations early. Fremont light show starts 7 pace your dinner. Amy true Broad loved history joint. Scott very attentive. Rib eye delicious. Halibut over top ! Relax enjoy atmosphere Friendly prompt but no warmth.
Not cozy place date.
Many things menu available settled Mob Meatballs default.
Pretty good but would rather ordered dinner.
Has going business feel it.

Very expensive.
Booze prices well more double rest Fremont St.
Especially if premium high premium drinks you'll really pay through your ass.

Not destination  sure.
The Plaza itself still ghetto ashtray stink piss lysol smelly bus station in defeat atmosphere lingers sticks you.

Can't imagine every going back especially several other much better places choose just short walk $6 Uber ride away. Now recent 3 star reviews way share new surprisingly enjoyable find before enter short period temporary hibernation.  place Oscar's Beef  Booze Broads.  Yes previous mayor's steakhouse opened some disappointment poor Yelp reviews!  glad waited until some kinks taken delivered product.  sure experienced marked improvement recent visit because quite impressed dining experience here.  All perfect but overall 4 1 2 star dining experience.

Let's begin beginning.  starters selected Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes which featured large hunks fresh lump crabmeat Stoned Ground Dijon Mustard Sauce Pepper Remoulade.  pair crab cakes very little filler waiter declared Pepper Remoulade especially mellow tasty accent crab.

Next Crazy Phil's Onion Soup.  first little disappointed its physical appearance because unlike most classic Onion Soups Gratinee crock soup did crusty crown cheese overlaying broth.  But once tasted beauty initial negative visual impression quickly mind.  Made sherry infused white wine veal stock deconstructing crouton Gruyere Cheese sweet broth other ingredients simply delicious.  truly outstanding hot French Onion Soup!

Complimentary Onion Bread visible pink onions also very good starter but didn't want continue eating Onion Bread all night backed off downing two slices butter.  Oscar's Chopped Salad artistically crafted nicely shaped circular mound creamed chopped vegetables topped sprouting Onion Straws.  salad containing Grape Tomatoes carrot shavings Italian Squash mostly diced zucchini tossed Maytag Bleu Cheese cool creamy refreshing.

An interesting twist then occurred large steak knives laid men dining party while much more slender petite steak knives set women. See pic. Diane bridled bit asked server why females provided same knives males.  serious expression he replied more appropriate furnish men a manly man's knife women elegant lady's knife. suppose whether person views practice sexist chivalrous depends one's point view.  also could deliberately done bit tongue cheek reflecting upon image Beef Booze Broads which restaurant plays rather down whimsical sort way.  Soon seated comely white gloved buxom blonde lacy black gown came over welcome us she said she broads. See pic. My slightly charred medium rare Filet cooked perfectly well very tasty house made Bearnaise Sauce.  large King Crab Leg Diane split warm rather hot very sweet Drawn Butter very hot either.  But Lobster Mashed Potatoes very hot very good except two tiny pieces shell encountered.  Wild Mushrooms very good second topping steak made sure stomach fully indulged particular night.

And complete fine meal oven baked Apple Cobbler Cinnamon Bread Crumbs chose which made La Cocotte Staub all metal Dutch oven served strawberry raspberries blackberries side two large scoops quickly melting Vanilla Ice Cream top delicious sounds!

With many tables booths facing Fremont Street Experience sumptuously decorated amid nice airy ambiance white tied waiters taking orders  under glass ceiling classy place turning memorable meals.  Hizzoner should proud new downtown eating palace! internet told ask Bobby disappointed! Also check free glass wine! Fuck ya! always wanted try Oscar's Steakhouse week while attending convention Plaza opportunity. restaurant small intimate Las Vegas steakhouse standards affords interesting even if obstructed view Downtown Freemont Street Experience. greeted seated promptly nice table checking Yelp given complimentary glass Pinot Noir which very nice. took waiter's suggestion ordered Prime New York steak sautéed mushrooms side creamed spinach. passed salad sure wouldn't even finish ordered I correct . While sampling fresh baked onion bread noticed appetizers being enjoyed adjoining table couldn't help but wish eating enough friends warrant appetizer two. calamari assorted cold cut cheese plate looked wonderful. dinner arrived reasonable wait very pleased steak. waiter spot on New York steak tender delicious done perfectly. mushrooms just good complimented steak. creamed spinach disappointing particularly since Ruth's Chris two weeks ago terrific there. Still meal very good overall due steak. service very good attentive.
One note clientele well dressed particularly current Las Vegas norms. made entire evening bit nicer.
I'm happy tried Oscar's wouldn't mind going back group especially try couple appetizer dishes. would order same steak but mushrooms spinach maybe salad instead. food ambiance near perfection if only service  would lived everything else.

I took Fiancé staycation Fremont st ventured down Oscar's she loves old Vegas feel downtown. window seat tint window view gold yellow antique feel watched crowd shuffling down street. couldn't asked much better that.

The food Awesomely cooked perfection filet mignon. Good Mac n Cheese great mashed potatoes creamy rich could eaten them all night. fiancé great looking salad huge baked potato tons liquid butter couldn't take bite without dumping butter table. 

Service poor however. waiter guessed evaluated two top minimum tip spent much more time interacting 4 7 tops section. offered specials received pitty smile. glasses empty most dinner glad brought bottle water. served multiple drinks bottles wine. beer empty no second offered.  When finished wanted desert but skipped then spent least 15 mins empty plates glasses before bus lady came clear table without receiving bill yet.

We mentioned service way manager wanted right lower bill etc but refused. food spectacular all saved experience here. Great bar especially bartender Rocky. Very disappointed dinner service though. dinner 2x unfortunately both times serviced Ray.  He sure likes bigger parties he feel nuisance. took 10mins 2 reminders want wine cocktail list. He doesn't let finish you're saying walks away. He doesn't even pack your leftovers.  Gave boxes bag pack them yourself. price should no brainer. bad coz food great. come town least 2x year trade show. come back but definitely sit Ray 's tables. First time Oscar's. Received complimentary appetizers drinks hosts business mixer. Very pleased quality apps huge crab cakes even huger sliders may beef lamb mix just amazing!
The ahi tuna meatballs also very good. gin martini blue cheese stuffed olives paired well food! 
The old school vibe all photos add steakhouse's appeal! 
Great views Fremont Street added bonus! 
The big chairs bar weren't all comfy though did look nice. Crab cakes way appetizer. Steak delicious right temperature blackened top. service fantastic super friendly. Also ambience true old Las Vegas attitude. Best part yet Oscar's office located must see!! Excellent service provided Bobby!!!!

All friends super excited try place Oscar's definitely delivered. server Bobby friendly knowledgeable fun! Everything start finish great cannot wait come back here. 

If you're looking great place eat dinner off strip come Oscar's! find ourselves downtown pretty often because out of town visitors stay hotels Fremont. place always made curious because honestly seems fancy Plaza. other hand heard co worker food actually good. random night few hours before restaurant opened made last minute decision eat here. called able reservation. restaurant located second floor dome overlooking Fremont Street. Apparently location used hotel's swimming pool back day.

Unfortunately didn't table window but  okay. could still see all Fremont table middle room. Service great. server friendly very knowledgeable menu. other servers very attentive well taking away empty plates immediately refilling drinks promptly. ordered Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes very good! Hot tasty liked basically just crab. few pieces red peppers but could barely taste them. mustard sauce nice touch well. Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac Cheese server said made 5 types cheese but very bland. Something avoid. Steamed Asparagus husband said weren't very good bit cold. Joey C's Filet Mignon 8 oz awesome! Cooked right very easy cut. very flavorful melt your mouth good! Prime Rib Carolyn's Cut husband ordered enjoyed it. favorite restaurant Prime Rib always Lawry's but he said pretty close!

i looking forward dessert but kitchen down while there. server said fans kitchen stopped working kept setting off fire alarms hotel. lucky tables food. staff apologizing other customers didn't chance order anything. 

I would come back again sure because great steak service. Maybe next time convince family members come along hope take care bill! P

FYI dress code business casual. Came visit Vegas 21st Birthday chose dinner here. first thought beautiful restaurant! 

The food delicious! ordered chicken artichokes well porkchops. sides mac cheese mashed potatoes onion strings. 


Our waiter Bradley he awesome! Super fun always made sure everything needed. definitely back again. genuine old time fabulous steakhouse every sense word. incredible time here. food service class act high quality all way. started crab cake shrimp cocktail divine. Crab cakes no filler just huge chunks delicious crabmeat. Huge succulent shrimp. incredible medium rare prime rib companion exquisite Filet Oscar. Loved experience beyond words! Classic old school steakhouse next Golden Gate Freemont.  NY Strip amazing.  Onion soup really good well.  Cut few nights earlier while place isn't fancy food better pricey.  return. wife Oscars nice quiet evening.  food service good but awesome.  couple things.  table two set sit side side going watch show.  less intimate difficult just nice dinner conversation.  also disappointing see many people show nice steakhouse shorts t shirts flip flops.  Why minimum dress code main restaurant unknown because Oscars does pretty amazing old Las Vegas feel it.   steak amazing bone rib eye filet Oscar wife portion size sides bit off almost big person but small share.  chopped salad fresh prepared just right.  may back but would request table closer front window less awkward seating. didn't eat dinner but five star happy hour possibly best town. Wine wells beer half off limited food menu stellar. 
Could've finished second beef carpaccio calamari fried perfectly crabcakes plump delicious chicken meatballs taste beef! Really love atmosphere service definitely back.  Historic classy spot sometimes rough downtown area. came walking around downtown Fremont.  quickly seated empty.  slow taking order which peeved little bit.  Anyway ordered strip steak girlfriend ordered some kind mozzerella other.

The skirt steak cooked really good.  Little bits garlic cooked into steak uber tender.  mozzarella ok.  Fresh.  bread butter table amazing.  butter where expression butter came from.  smooth warm.  goodness. Yum.

The reason give place 3 stars instead 5 because even though food splendid price isnt.  steak minimum 40 something dollars.   heck.  Am made money?

If money no issue then eat here.
