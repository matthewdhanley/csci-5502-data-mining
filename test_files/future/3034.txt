 Came groupon 2nd time last year well thought well worth $15 spent.  shared appetizer sampler mango margaritas.  No complaints.  waiter bit flat....I wonder if stiffed lot people using coupons???  I'd say both times fine especially considering paid.  I'd definitely again...with groupon! Food ok but service incredibly slow small lunch crowd.  Waitress no idea beers draft.  Maybe dinner staff better.... Great food service. Waitress attentive kind. Lots TVs good place watch games. definitely come again. today early lunch groupon.  service poor waited long time and when hardly anyone dining area service.  honestly say spinach artichoke dip wonderful chips best ever warm where warm ends. food served cold Mr. ordered brisket sandwich dressed junkyard dog bacon strips diced menu said harder eat onion crisps top hotdog great.  some unique items menu.  servers seemed disappear.  only thing server did which really nice needed refills diet pepsi she brought pitcher diet pepsi.. thank goodness she did would really creek.  Nothing taken off table when finished eating then noticed no table cleaned guests finished appetizers ..the plates just piled up.  BTW did present groupon till bill issue poor service.. man if those servers hustled more would better tips maybe better reviews. Save your self some frustration money eat here. arrived 6pm seated hostess. far good.  received menus placed drink orders waitress.  Looked around restaurant noticed 20 tables only 2 tables food strange.  Only waitress duty.  Saw 3 tables walk restaurant. Table next ours left food ordered table left because sick tired waiting order.  place trys come off bbq type restaurant.  Only thing bbq sauce pour food. Nothing bbq.  ordered ribs brisket flank steak.  Ribs $22 5 ribs.  Ribs tasted boiled fatty no flavor. joke!  Brisket no flavor except bbq sauce small portion.  Flank steak tough shoe leather. place terrible!!  may 2 1 coupon still feel ripped off.  Upon leaving noticed cook waitress texting talking phone standing around while bunch tables waiting food. Very unprofessional!  warned. Unless wait terrible food ans service somewhere else. really did place smelled smoke food service great. purchased Groupon am thankful did. would back there. husband Rock 'N' Ritas bar bbq Las Vegas very disappointed service. wasn't really busy only waited 5 minutes seated. looked fun place food seemed good. but waited table waitress take drink order 20 minutes. time 3 different waitresses walked past table even looking us. when realized nobody paying attention left. another couple behind did same thing. returning restaurant Obsessed. it's... experience say least.  While didn't take advantage mini porcelains filled chili JD group did order mixed drink bucket. Seriously 124 oz bucket filled mixed drink some sort topped 151. Talk Vegas!

Aside great party atmosphere fun drinks food delicious.  brisket AWESOME especially paired mac 'n cheese.  price Vegas definitely more expected.

In case any good games huge projection TV back Christopher. Shhh

Great place amazing service coupon BOGO dinner entree free helped ease disappointment. 

Service way slow. Waiter would walk never refill drinks until asked.

Thin fries only good thing. Tri Tip garlic mash dry. Shrimp Slider Sampler okay. BBQ beans much BBQ sauce.

Atmosphere fun but cigarette smoke adjacent upper bar ruined meal. lady bar smoking away without drink.  Good reminder why don't eat casino restaurants open casino floor. First off A 1 service waitress Shannon. She top drinks made sure orders right tasted acceptable. 

A couple party burgers said good. chicken salad fairly tasty. 

While food nothing special everyone finished meals without complaint. certainly better places found but if looking reasonably priced meal don't feel leaving Circus Circus casino don't want stand ridiculous line buffet then come here. 

Also if looking place beer watch your favorite game your best option Circus Circus several large screens dedicated sports. 

P.S. 'Rock Roll' theme joint extremely tacky. done intentionally someone completely clueless really tough decide which though. Bad service least 7 dirty tables all around food blah! 3rd time hoping maybe would redeem themselves. Wouldn't return if free! Wanted fried Twinkie desert out!!! What? crispy cream fried sandwich sounded great but another let down.  veggie grilled sandy bread change please add some flavor! Mayo something. Just blah. down night late something eat weren't overly hungry. boyfriend jut ordered dessert krispy kreme ice cream sandwich could love this? two thumbs up. ordered corn soup which actually half bad spicy creamy but deep fried pickles....oh dear. gross greasy. Limp slimy peeled off all breading patted down pickles napkin ate them that. Overall $32 tax tip totally worth it. Could just late night hour but other reviews place don't seem anyone else overly enjoyed it. I'd say save your money find some yummy place strip eat. use groupon $30 $15. ribs juicy moist. Very surprising casino joint. sides ok though beans mashed potatoes which looked sitting side dishes evaporated under heating lamp. BBQ sauce tasty but nothing really special. 

This place worth groupon much without groupon. Very disappointing.  seated ourselves obvious nobody cares assist is.  waitress knew waited 10 minutes before leaving because weren't even asked drinks point. tried inordinate amount time service place. never happened. sign told find hostess seated waited until certain no coming. decided active walked down manager two waiters clearly said excuse me? paid no mind  only response them hearty fuck . decided ask some people sitting tables host ess seated served said didn't know because sitting being ignored 20 minutes. tried going bar promptly ignored. Finally decided place did deserve patronage left real uproar throwing down menu frustration very long attempt very much vain. Sadly don't think actually bankrupt due location but certainly wish closed some other reason health violations serving alcohol minors because certainly deserve it. Major fail. Searched online good lunch spot found place originally picked closed. Happened place ended going every meal! 
Breakfast 4 5 had morning shuffle best scramble ever! he eggs Benedict great sauce! heavy. Pitcher coffee brought table don't need keep flagging down waitress. Quick service! Home fries could used kick but uniformly crunchy which hard come by.
Lunch 3 5 both shared nacho platter am somewhat nacho platter expert little disappointed used yellow nacho cheese instead real cheese cause chips soggy other wise just ok. both mini sandwich sampler delicious! Fries great too! Shoe string thin very crunchy. coconut rum drink can't remember name but  because really good! apparent hostesses picked more hotness customer service skills wait despite having half tables empty. smile would nice because hostess all... 
Dinner 5 5!! 2 1 dinners!!! 16oz melt your mouth Cajun rib eye BEST mashed potatoes EVER he BBQ ribs fell off bone both agreed best we'd ever had. HATE coleslaw being said boyfriend almost stabbed fork trying eat all good! Topped off giant keepsake porcelain toilet bowl filled mango rockin Rita margarita. OMG. Only regret didn't enough room left deep fried twinkies really wanted try!
Decor 3 5 Red Neck Pop Art classy joint but amazing food relative cost. Noted large stage being used. Why not!? Also would've liked see more team circus circus bartender flair heavily hyped drink menu.  
What ultimately sealed deal won comment overhearfrom woman while leaving bite stratosphere paraphrase just spent $500 sh$  ! Food sky now wait line elevator? NEVER AGAIN! moral story if want some classy $h! don't Rock Ritas but if you're some bangin food reasonable price toilet bowls over flow booze then your place! Don't PLEASE!!!! Mom ate only giving star because mom said meatloaf good. fried Bologna sandwich can't mess WRONG. guy taking order customer service issues. Please tell why folk working public jobs worst attitudes salmon dinner made really regret having ordered pizza room rather taking Circus! Circus! coupon included check in  booklet.  

The salmon completely flavorless steamed vegetables soft bland they'd compete against best hospital food.  Waitstaff seemed disinterested best noticed booth sat dust all over decorations wall.

Portions small well.  Definitely think twice before making your evening dinner out. never back.  Food ok.  could add regular BBQ sauce cook same results.  atmosphere terrible.  fight on.  volume 12 tv's way loud restaurant all sports bar. Just before meal served turned lights down or might off .  Could see eating.  table next just seated. I don't know read menu. . told could turn lights up.  dark.....too noisy. $50 comp decided try Rock Ritas..
We started Margaritas brisket quesadilla. small lime rocks husband tried frozen strawberry. drinks good flavor but seemed weak.
For meals tri tip garlic mashed potatoes onion straws. meat cooked perfectly but wished made own sauce rather bottled Sweet Baby Rays buy store. potatoes little dry onion straws average.
My husband ribs beans cole slaw. He said ribs really tender tasty. beans little spice but best side cole slaw. wet slaw lots flavor tomatoes twist.
Our server Amar very attentive friendly including making suggestions. burger Western overcooked but husband's garbage burger die for.

Good drinks place reasonably priced.

Just general note hostess any restaurant.  If someone says child autistic would seated away noise... Just happen. Rock Rita's Time Consuming Disappointing

The short version glad Living Social would Epic Fail!

The long version husband bought Living Social $15 $30 before came Vegas. Friday before Memorial Day weekend around 3pm. busy seemed adequately staffed.

We seated quickly but took forever waitress take order. Then took forever food. Then took forever check. would easy place skip check! start finish over hour half!

We shared Caesar salad portions great but way much dressing. wiping dressing off lettuce. husband chicken quesadilla impressed. ordered Turkey Ham sandwich. Extremely disappointed! description sound hot sandwich. All cold cuts slice Kraft cheese Texas toast.

The saving grace desert! If don't regular food deserts drinks because grilled Krispy Kreme donut w ice cream fantastic! manager really nice she made appropriate chit chat while handling Living Social discount.

Side notes * internet connection sucks there.
* took almost hour New York New York hotel Circus Circus where Rock Rita's located 45 min back.
* Even w Living Social Groupon wouldn't back. yummy...yummy...yummy!!! best hot chicken wings corn chowder. wow. yummy meaty spicy...loves .  pulled pork sandwhich man tri tip sandwhich. may little better but both super yummy.  Really cool place unique things take home.  Would rather spend less $5.25 beer but thats vegas you.  Such good food didnt wait line but would back. wish tried dessert.  guess next time. would start review disclaimer....I reviewing drinks atmosphere. place amazing! bf seeing add 1 2 off margaritas sign outside Circus Circus. ended even getting deal for. order those large drinks see everyone strip walking around with. bartender GREAT! He entertaining welcoming. He made drinks even put show while sat bar. During show he another bartender begin shift put show throwing bottles doing other tricks. During show gave every complimentary drinks. tasted water but still fun. think time bf left bar drunk loving it. first time Vegas really enjoying myself. stayed 2 hours. If stayed any longer dont think  would've able walk place. music also great...a variety top 20 rock music. great place drinks before dinner. place blows!!! service decent food terrible! fried pickles appetizer roll each three paper towels HALF grease off!  chicken really dry even covered extra barbecue sauce take drink every small bite wouldn't choke.  cornbread dry potato salad tasted came carton market. . DON'T Waste your money people!!! wonderful experience. place never done wrong. Food amazing staff great all around good time. lunch ordered version club sandwich only able eat half it. thing big piled high meat. Amazing. recommend place anyone loves food much do. portions quite big. But quality cheap side. All food super greasy real big calorie bomb.
We wait 7 minutes silverware food served. Overall waitress very inattentive unfriendly.

By way watch garbage burger! says free beer if finish burger. Actually burger gets served ultra hot sauce huge fat clump yes pure fat side. eat both them also otherwise don't free beer.
And course tell afterwards nobody likes drink 4 oz super spicy Tabasco sauce. atmosphere great fun although toilet bowl picture sicken shouldn't table. food great  although  limited choice. ate twice because coupon handed door but both time service lousy breakfast kitchen ask coffee then told wait table someone would come did waited waited. When dinner same thing happen although coffee but waiter serving meals he didn't come back until he came check.
 
These people need training. When menu item note next saying speciality place touting its BBQ course going order that. many places specialize burgers eggs order junk here. Well must give Rita's despite touristy atmosphere decent nod brisket. sliced Texas style pretty tender choice three sauces. tried them all. Personally good judge brisket because just ate 36 diiferent BBQ places Southern USA while traveling work. regards those places doesn't come close but Vegas can't recall finding much good brisket around town. $9.99 side dish garlic red skinned potatoes needed more garlic decent deal if your brisket fan area. order bar which less lonely grabbing table inside. 
      OK admit using lunch special coupon but only saves $1 visit ordered sloppy joe sandwich $6.99. Honestly can't recall ever finding sloppy joe menu years pretty tasty novelty order. sure sloppy joe stand but give bun toasted egg bun both sandwiches huge plus. Yum! Ulcerator burger delicious! Great prices! tried place because huge sandwiches heard about. also coupon helped decision.
Well order mac cheese knowing ham it. good but picked ham. also beef brisket sandwich huge good filling!
I also ordered fries...delicious! placed order directly manager maybe she made sure perfect cause no complaints! knew???? review bar only.
My trip Vegas two years ago OCT 2011 still remember experience here. 
Our group friends big plans going downtown Fulton Street last day Vegas but didn't past Rock Ritas wouldn't any other way. bartenders' name David he probably favorite bartender whole trip super fun personable. Anytime Shots song came bartenders bar start pouring mix liquor juice straight into mouths bar guests.
Cool experience being Circus Circus hotel. really Denny's quality food red lobster price. fires dry hallow. If buy groupon  best deal! Cheeseburgers dry taste less. Macho Nachos top layer only layer cheese fake no guacamole sour cream. aunt lured lunch special 6.99 coupon but worth it
the waiter nice. but very attentive
our food
TOOK FOREVER __ the spinach dip ok.. pita chips bit odd.
the caesar salad wraps recommended pretty average did long wait. their alcoholic beverage menu looked interesting though 24hr vacation Husband 2 teenage kids 18 19 Las Vegas. read online Rock Rita's good food good spirits wanted give try. family of 6 total seated right away round table plenty room !! all ordered different foods New York Strip Awsome Tender Full Flavor Meatloaf Melts your Mouth BBQ Flank Steak Full Delicious !! Beef Brisket WoW !! Husbands sons ordered Junkyard Dog Garbage Burger ate every bite!!! Husband shared Huge Margarita together the glass big Fish Bowl LOL ...YUMMMM!!! give Resturant 10 FIVE STARS!!! back!!! Thank Rock Ritas great meal great day!!!  Sincerely Andrea C California area Buy beers yes! meatloaf sandwich fries loved both. Place isn't classiest place around but really enjoyed food. Place looks chain something hate but only around. cheesy chain feel because cheesiest casino strip Circus Circus.  Normally would never place but circumstances brought end strip sandwich just needed. turkey burger service chocolate cake all commonality. all good made fun experience. Because when you're eating Circus Circus should positive experience. turkey burger made some spices which helped create just right flavor. many turkey burgers best. Service quick during late lunch early dinner time. looks pretty fun menu enjoy returning try few new items. lunch complimentary trade review. okay. drinks served toilet bowl which pretty weird. didn't really convince one. food. mushroom swiss friend classic burger other friend Pastrami sandwich. fries really small but really crisp tasty. 

My burger cooked correctly but only tasted mediocre. just much cheese me. friends felt same way food. Service wasn't bad but enough come back. Circus Circus far down strip worth trip there. Mediocre food. Waitress didn't know anything drinks. Most positive reviews look fake me. There's no way anybody could positive ordinary food this. inside Circus Circus clue. Eh good place use comp dollars but don't your way eat there. seems someone never tasted real BBQ would trying BBQ. Decor felt forced glad Groupon. Wish kids very talented balloon artist balloons probably better food. Decent BBQ joint. ribs both nights. best part toughest desicion which AWESOME glasses drink of. Bong o toilet. only complaint inability put custom drink toilet cup. Overall most consistently good place Circus Circus places ate over 1 week trip. Food took hour. Did receive discount but lost appetite. Food cold. say very disappointed service received place.  family waitress seemed if she did want serve she just having bad day however when customer service job should customers feel if good time.  am sad say bad service over shadowed good food served. If don't mind hit miss service good time cause food very good. would say if don't eat then don't it. bar tries really hard cute but its terribly expensive food worth $20 head spent. Plus don't really good bar selection either. mean guess you're Circus Circus.

I only gave them two stars because seems wait staff nice but even kind slow. food took forever come barely anyone weekday night. Boo! Dinner mixture adults children Food = 2 Star If Drunk Feeling Generous
Service = 1 Star

Review Rock Rita's Food Drinks = Swill

swill plural swills mixture solid liquid food scraps fed pigs etc especially kitchen waste purpose decent meal venue. Large portions but decent food. 2 1 through travel company used which bit result. Also staff friendly quick which liked...

All all decent food decent price...cant wrong!! made way novelty toilet bowl sipper full margarita maybe grab bite.  ended leaving nothing.  customer service horrid.  waited several minutes without being noticed all.  ordered novelty drink commenced waiting.  several minutes flagged down server promised drinks forthcoming.  several more minutes just decided leave.  never ordered food. place just ok start.

I am pretty sure overwelming smoked flavor brisket liquid smoke otherwise half way decent. side note middle night scrub hands face because overwelming bbq smell.

The sides pretty good both slaw fries ranked pretty high.
My meal served any napkins hands covered BBQ sauce before realized just happening.

My waitress fine but fun any personal touch overall impression entire staff dialing in.

If paying meal wouldnt happy but comp decent option another buffet.

I bet place could time alot fun. 

If dont buy into hype expect authentic BBQ just big drink fine here. $50 food comp MyVegas decided try breakfast Rock 'n Ritas. restaurant wasn't busy when arrived seated immediately. children ordered pancakes tried steak eggs French toast. All food delicious waitress friendly efficient. Prices very reasonable would happy eat even without comp. 

Based some other reviews place perhaps dinner isn't way but would definitely recommend stopping breakfast. Lace working design project Caesars Palace until late while waiting around Slot Fun her. wanted quick dinner told pick circus circus. Saw sign Rock Rita's decided stop quick. Thought going Mexican restaurant but actually BBQ spot! pulled pork sandwich she brisket sandwich. Both really good sandwiches staff very attentive friendly. manager even checked twice very polite. good daily drink specials also live band night. Would back sure meal prices range $9 $17. Overall thought place pretty decent. Vegas husband 2 small children yes Vegas family friendly! . 
We enjoyed some fun kids circus shows games then ate lunch Rock $ Rita's. hadn't eaten any BBQ while trip gave shot. wouldn't say great place real BBQ but food decent enough. ordered 1 2 chicken garlic mash potatoes onion straws. asked extra BBQ sauce chicken onion straws. Once poured some each tasted just fine! 
My hubby ordered slider combo plate came 4 different sliders fries. 
My daughter 3 years old strangely ordered fish sticks fries she enjoyed them. 
The draw really BOGO FREE margaritas. actually pretty strong. 
In closing place pretty good! can't speak other restaurants inside Circus Circus. good time food good. Server ok personable though. usually Groupon Buy free entree Las Vegas Coupon Books. food actually pretty good. portions far meat could better but thought taste pretty satisfying. brisket which slow cooked could maybe slow cooked more but taste really good Corn bread nice sponge like. If don't discount place then probably would just leave alone but if coupon Groupon pretty worth Oh service pretty crappy took forever someone assist give check never refill drinks. Food wise liked service wise sucked. heads set menus certain times if don't find anything you'd somewhere else.  

We early lunch almost empty might add . ordered sandwich sampler since really didn't find anything appealing. sandwich sampler beef dip sloppy joe fried bologna bbq pork sandwich. All sandwiches served Hawaiian sweet buns which made sliders sweet. fried bologna grey poupon made taste pretty unbearable. sloppy joe tangy beef dip didn't even come w the au jus sauce. bbq pork tender but because bun sweet.

Server Katheryn horrible. didn't even start eating yet she brought check. wait 15+ min refill water remind twice . other tables she slightly more courteous wonder if she's racist well we only non caucasians .

Only good if you're drunk late night since 24hr came expecting blehh but came pretty satisfied. Maybe bc hella starving? shared bbq ribs ny strip steak. okay but loved mashed potatoes mushroom gravy. mmm craving right now. little pricey but id come back. Bit short handed but cheaper buffet... but pay for. only reason gets two stars vs. food decent.

Food decent. Shoestring fries good homemade chili chili burger sweet flavor but lacked kick. Sadly  where stopped. 

A $6 kids veggie platter consisted some ranch baby carrots celery sticks some broccoli florets something could done $2 local grocery store's produce dept.

My wife ordered French Dip however baguettes offered something else prepare regular sesame bun. She opted latter but meant she could no longer easily dip sandwich included au jus. then took 10 minutes someone's attention some horseradish sauce sandwich more palatable.

As service place less half occupied but took hostess 5 10 minutes seat us. When finally did stuck corner relative other tables . server all busy but still far less attentive. server's attention more once when needed sauce refills. When asked more iced tea she brought pitcher left table could pour own. She someone else deliver check. attention just give payment someone else delivered card sign. 

I'm usually good tipper but time. breakfast very few options available stayed mediocre Circus Circus. While place new clean also... like... tackiest place seen date fake rock roll theme. 

After being seated booths given breakfast menus. options fairly limited but prices decent service lightning fast.

I Breakfast Shuffle three eggs shuffled chorizo sausage green onions Monterey Jack cheddar cheeses. also came served breakfast potatoes.

While potatoes very tasty eggs cook unevenly making weird experience every bite different taste texture caused bit morning anxiety... cheese flavorless added nothing dish somehow. hardened instead which lead believe sub par quality. far green onions chorizo barely any each there. Honestly very impressed.

Having already known Circus Circus mediocre high hopes place especially since you'd think they'd step since there's such few options available hotel. But nope instead just average best. real shame really. While sure probably better drinks stuff why bother serving breakfast if aren't going right? couple stars received service which great. But far food failed. coupon eat when checked in $6.99 breakfast second half free something effect. breakfasts which served rather surely waitress average. If only experience would given three stars but another night very late just looking late dinner found ourselves place.
It very crowded but loud if three times many people there. small group trashy very obese people scream singing karaoke stage front restaurant. them singing Eminem others screaming cheering. sat down back try avoid chaos but way disruptive. Other people sitting middle dinners therefore stuck looking pained. didn't bother putting ourselves through left. crappy menu  overpriced anyway.
I guess Rock Rita's name really says all but basically if you're fall down cheap drunk don't think you'll much say place. price think eating buffet would've better choice. quality food decent bad. family came breakfast time finished content.

Probably would've more entertaining eat evening but oh well. food average best brisket which perfectly described Jamie T. below said ...they indicated menu house specialty. try it. only brisket dry but tasted microwaved only flavor could taste BBQ sauce slathered top. sent back said they'd take off bill. bill came still there. asked took off. service better average but great. food definitely great but prices first class barbeque. wasn't close. Several table ribs. $24.00 should rack but 1 3 that.

This place INSIDE Circus Circus wasn't mentioned anywhere took bit figure looking small BBQ shop street. If known advance would prepared Circus Circus low mediocre experience known low prices. caters families kids saw more kids strollers walked garage Rock Rita's did following 4 days spent Vegas combined.

This typical megacorp institutional food locally owned BBQ shop which thought would no mention Circus Circus Groupon. guessing intentional.

If you're staying CC your kids need adult time yourself place escape order quick bite beer they reasonable beer choices some adult conversation. adult party looking fun delicious barbeque experience wasn't it. Decided place because BBQ sounded really good! Came food credits walked almost all they're pricey! 

Service bad. Don't wrong servers nice would come around every once blue moon but would ask them something they'd say yes then show until 20 minutes later. They'll wandering around meantime. Food takes normal amount time no big deal. 

My mother ordered root beer float decided she liked it. However only gave water table four?? supposed share it? sure logic one. 

We ordered classic burger fries chorizo jalapeno chowder BBQ chicken sandwich salad instead fries two meats plate veggies mashed potatoes. Burger okay normal would guess. Dad didn't soup he said spicy. But looked pretty good. 

Fries delicious. They're cut tiny but they're incredibly crispy crunchy yummy. finished whole side fries pickles. Yum. 

For two meat combo $29.99?? ribs tri tip. Tri tip almost turned dust mouths. dry. tried smothering sauce over but didn't really help. 

The ribs didn't much flavor ask more BBQ sauce. mom liked better but didn't try it. already wary. Mashed red potatoes didn't flavor overmashed add ton seasonings it. Veggies distinct grilled flavor. restaurant mostly empty packed. Food actually ok.  service CRAZY slow.  took waiter 20 minutes just take drink order.  weren't busy.  watched waiter walk kitchen prep area nothing hands.  Teach your staff multitask! 'ulcinator' burger....mediocre best. very disappointed. only spicy hot advertised cannot say much flavor it. Plus fries below luke warm. don't think would come back...for food anyways. Service wasn't great. Food mediocre. impressed probably wouldn't return. place sucked. always over cooked food. manager yelled employee front family me. didn't it. Glad shut down. Prices better most las vegas restaurants.  Chili good but much rice.  Fries good. Chicken noodle soup bland. Bacon salad tasty but no bacon. Slider sample mediocre. Busy place long wait...

Food mediocre....

BUT margaritas super good. I'd come back just those!!! Karaoke place

I didn't order anything fancy classic All American Burger... good loved fries! Service okay a little slow almost 10 00p. But waitress nice friendly!  karaoke place some karaoke participants good... MC wasn't good though ... somewhat corny. sorry restaurant located Circus Circus Casino confusing parking area. 3 sections.  Also Groupon deal... okay paid for.

Review #0133 sisters... all impression racist..as waited 15 mins anyone acknowledge us...then when sister tried ordering all American burger waitress started laughing said sarcastic tone oh sure want allllll AMERICAN burger then walked away helping other tables felt uncomfortable said fuck walked ...not mention hostess same way dad just plain racist . decided visit Rock Rita's on May 16th finding Groupon online. told hostess wait table yet 90% restaurant empty. 

After many people talked brisket and indicated menu house specialty try it. only brisket dry but tasted microwaved only flavor could taste BBQ sauce slathered top.

As side beans I'd rather buy own Bush's baked beans thank very much pay someone prepare them me. boyfriend convinced having few bites cole slaw didn't taste right later he sick it. service almost non existent. don't dining places where feel physically hunt down waiter only them look they're being bothered. quite few drink options which tasty but nothing extraordinary but would definitely suggest stay away food. all started mistake. clicked buy Groupon offer Rock Rita's. $10 discount curious. Little did know when clicked would given chance confirm. bought. Then came research Yelp. Rock Rita's less stellar star rating. But am committed. certificate paid dinner its way. 

When arrived restaurant deep inside big top Circus Circus impressed having stand podium waiting missing hostess. read reviews led believe could take while. She actually came back rather quickly seated.  friend checked menu bit joked toilet bowl options available before placing order. He ordered Ulcerator buger. ordered tri tip sandwich. burger looked great he happy it. sandwich good but great. meat did taste freshly smoked. prefer more BBQ sauce. fries however awesome. Crunchy shoe string potatoes tons flavor.

My friend ordered couple drinks. pina colada start some Malibu rum test tube mix in. But when bill came initial drink plus food value certificate still used up. another drink ordered. waiter tried bring free charge. cool all but trying actual bill rather free meal because neither cash tip. wanted put card. waiter brought seperate bill charging $0.01 second drink then left tip. Kind round way doing but hey whatever works right? far worst food poor service  encountered.
Still trying decide if food service worst.
I NEVER eat place again!
not worth star place used called Pink Pony. Now new name change very hesitate going eat. decided check anyway since family. getting table took 10 minutes waitress acknowledge us. when she did she took another 5 minutes orders drinks food. absolutely thought. NO TIP! food took 15 minutes family 7 which bad. ordered Caesar Chicken Wrap which came fries. tasted pretty good. husband ordered Pulled Pork Sandwich yummy! say took awhile figure wanted because everything menu didn't seem something really wanted eat. torn place. Fries? Good! Inferno wings? Awesome! Pulled pork? Mushy flavor wasn't very good. consistency dog food. Ulcerator may better hamburger raw. Service ok. Nobody group very impressed eith experience. loved it. used Groupon. But food worth full price opinion. would pay full price food. Fast service friendly service. portabella burger amazing fries hot. 5 star but if you're circus circus you're looking 5 start. Would definitely eat again. Service AWESOME.  
Servers super FRIENDLY.
Restaurant really spacious clean played awesome music! definitely played jams! 

Now sad part....

Food didn't taste good.  mean edible but tasty side.  ordered sampler http www.yelp.com biz_photos rock and ritas las vegas?userid=N4K69ZdyU B8NzVYxwjK0A#NwszeOYtFHoGOHLtNpnqcQ brisket dish http www.yelp.com biz_photos rock and ritas las vegas?userid=N4K69ZdyU B8NzVYxwjK0A#UYhmORthQuXqctUxW7eVgg along 2 sodas which totaled $50.   Pretty pricey... except comped meal Circus Circus.

Anyway don't know why fried pickles tasted weird but did.  liked french fries chili cheese nachos sampler.  nachos decent but cheese dried quickly.  briskets soft tender but smelled funny.

These those restaurants where really gotta use ketchup bbq sauce hot sauce your meal taste good. Rockin Rita's tries down home type place but some novelties stomach churn uneasiness. When sifting through menu saw pictures little mini toilet bowls filled Chili blue alcoholic beverages. sure thought clever but just conjures images don't want think before eat.

My cousin ordered ribs which $22.00. When came mine okay but wasn't fall off bone terrific . cousin's tougher husband even hard time cutting into it. waiter came asked food was. cousin says really want know ? waiter cautiously says Yes . complainer but worst ribs ever life. Just record cousin complainer LOL but she point. customer service really good why gave them three stars instead two. nice offered another menu item replace ribs removed ribs off bill. She ordered medium rare burger which came really rare. just looked seared both sides burger. Most red cousin didn't really eat but tired complaining. didn't  finish ribs made queasy.  bite husband's jalapeno burger wished ordered instead. brother loved junkyard dog. He said wouldn't though because salty. brother husband ordered krispy creme sundae.  bite little sweet me.

Overall food hit miss but customer service really top notch! Inside Circus Circus casino. small variety American dishes. chili hamburger good seasoning shoe string fries good well. Mean prices pretty average however drinks waaay overpriced! use casino credits food alcohol if comp $s good place eat. 

Service bar terrible would recommend trying eat main restaurant instead side bars. 

Checked $0.25 Wings during football games. Wings aren't worth more $0.25 each no huge savings person needs more dozen but taste isn't bad. 

So second time around... OMG changed mind... hamburger fully cooked wings made sick... maybe burger. Fries chewy. Service.. just bad before. never eating again. bad because wanted try desert... sick desert? absolutely starving decided check place...wish hadn't. food lackluster all cheap NO RITAS! suppose needed look apostrophe but kind hoping would variety margaritas...but alas Rita just name.  hopes dashed left food which wasn't anything I'd give second thought to. day no live music no real ambiance speak of. liked Rock Rita's.  Groupon which helped price. ordered sample platter sandwiches really happy it. didn't expecting best meal I'd Vegas but end trip ended being favorites.  I'd again. did however watch man stand hostess counter probably 15 mins before anyone even acknowledged him.  service fine but sure man would say same. guess could way. only writing review place because think deserves more two starts. most people used $6.99 coupon all American breakfast 3 eggs potatoes toast your choice meat. meal itself great came timely manner. thing really stood when leaving server said blessed day religious anything but  something never heard something feel adds very personal touch. 

For next time though suggestion guys should probably someone host stand seating people if line people waiting seated. EEW.  If didn't 6.99 coupon probably wouldn't ate  anyway but...we towards end Vegas weekend pretty tapped out. sandwich sampler good was. can't remember seeing fried bologna sandwich menu anywhere else before. fries good too.

The service...pretty bad. waitress seemed annoyed whole time flustered whenever asked question. don't think she likes job.

The Margaritas Uh rita your name then WORSE MARGARITA EVER HAD.  saying lot because tried them all. 

Basically $6 soda would more worth it.  crushed ice plastic cup salted rim filled water splash tequila. think put tiny bit sweet sour yellow. tequila flavored water. margarita.

I don't really whole down home backyard theme.  would want eat drink anything replica toilet. swear 12 year old boys came this. think all food offered strip why settle place? Well groupon covers alcohol worth it.  if don't something similar its worth IMO. When first walked immediately noticed trash old food still floor...ewww. Waitress friendly but orders wrong incomplete all around table. Add already mediocre just skip place spend more money better food save some down strip Denny's. family took trip Las Vegas past summer' we're some casino searching good place eat. Rock Rita's music selection captivated moment walked passed joint. immediately made U turn into seated. ambiance Rock Rita's sort resembles old 50's Diner love 50's era however food did love nor Customer Service. Once seated hispanic man came took order. however did know wanted  took little while decided could feel waiter's patience slip second asked if he could come back he wasn't happy that. Anyway looking over menu noticed all selections didn't seem appetizing Caesar Salad lol. When waiter came back asked if could Caesar Salad instead Caesar Dressing Ranch Dressing. waiter then told wanted isn't Caesar Salad. kind ticked off because knew Caesar Salad didn't ask opinion. Moreover just wanted salad plain side ranch dressing. waiter then tangent explaining Caesar dressing mixed into Caesar salad honest over already just wanted leave but waiter waiter finally took order down took back chef. took 30 minutes order bowel lettuce croutons parmesan cheese side ranch dressing. lettuce fresh hell which probably best thing came Rock Rita experience. Everything thing else ticked off whomever waited hope he learns proper etiquette order waiter. Also hope Rock Rita's new Menu next summer because isn't good... because $50 comp playing slot games Vegas FB.   waiter little slow but worth food wise.  ordered 2 meat plates. husband ribs brisket brisket chicken.  portions large enough feed 4 6 people both plates.  food very tasty.  worth every penny spent... Tri tip plate ehhh. Tri tip cooked little long potato salad good cole slaw tragic. No flavor whatsoever .

Tri tip plate ehhh. Tri tip cooked little long potato salad good cole slaw tragic. No flavor whatsoever .BBQ sauce good.

the food fabulous ... prices amazing !!! 
the service incredible server very attentive he checked every 5 10 min 
the drinks crazy good ... husband shared SUCK BUCKET huge bucket full liquor !!!! 

we Saturday night ... live music ... ROCK MUSIC !!! awesome ... 
ILL definitely  coming back  !!!! would describe restaurant's atmosphere Fun filled white trashy vibe absolute love scatalogical humor buddy catch quick breakfast before leaving town service quick enough breakfast burrito ok... just trouble eating considering Rock Rita's feature cocktail thick brownish liquid floating brown chunks served mini porcelain toilet.  

Of course would never order but advertisements said cocktail all over restaurant including being prominently featured paper place mats. 

Overall place perfect trashy poop joke loving clientele Circus Circus strives for. boyfriend bought groupon rock rita before came vegas. came Friday afternoon. order beef brisket ribs w bake beans fries. drank giant margarita. all good. Server fast friendly. Manager scanned group very pleasant too.  If looking fun friendly place some food drinks try place. Worst service ever experienced. lunch time sat table over 10 minutes. stare bar tender hoping he gets message...he doesn't. friend asks menus. order food drinks still again walk bar order. friend became server. sure all bad reviews place since experience excellent!  even before drank 44 ounce margarita.  

There maybe two empty tables saw but service still prompt.  karaoke night which sometimes worries ruin ambiance but music just right volume.

My food order came quickly burger piled high toppings come out. .. drink a lime Rock Rita margarita rocks easy salt served exactly ordered it... lot flavor very good!

The burger referring Ulcerator or something that excellent!  stacked ham provolone mozzarella jalapeños onion strings... finished pretty tasty bbq sauce. 

Overall if ever find myself hungry very likely Circus Circus again not likely then would likely back! very disappointed restaurant. husband ordered ribs brisket combo ordered beef brisket sons ordered bacon burger cheese burger.  kids liked food okay.  But ribs brisked horrible if reheated left overs texture dog food.  atmosphere seemed fun first but then vibe employees just burst bubble.  bus boy looked he absolutely hated job look face body language.  waiter took order he brought food he disappeared seen again until he brought bill no dinner? need anything else? etc....  nothing!  husband owner small business he always sure customer service important.  Needless say restaurant overpriced less mediocre.  hope owner restaurant reads reviews some changes. review bar area only. did into restaurant area but mom did happy it. Personally enjoyed 2 1 margarita special Saturdays. them rocks slushy machine unless want brain freeze . Those slushy ones usually all sugar. rocks salt brim...wowie! Great bargain! Vegas usually expensive food looks pretty doesn't fill up.  them.  Food reasonably priced $10 $14 ish plate enough food left overs!  mac cheese yum!  BF chicken parmesan pasta came very nice piece juicy chicken.  

Lots TVs also great while watched UFC.

Cons Having weave through all kids casino.
