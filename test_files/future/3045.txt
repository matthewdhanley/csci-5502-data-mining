 Great service . Courtney lovely cute return steak Mac cheese . wife waiting while finally made time bring family in. around 11 30 pretty busy seated right away which good because brought both kids. waitress approached soon seated let know menu everything works. ordered kids right away orders drinks ourselves. wife ordered bloody Mary waitress recommended beer decided it. When she returned she brought Bloody Mary kids drinks 20 min still no beer me.... wife decides ask waitress she said must problem bar noticed she computer put beer through because she must forgot put in. beer another 10 minutes later 30 min ordered it . kids sliders ordered huntsman burger calamari share. burger no side plates kids sliders but no calamari. burger delicious! once finished burger asked waitress if calamari coming still. She kitchen returned no calamari told order bumped..... sure means happened. calamari 10 min later ask since already done everything else.  food ok service wasn't great. think someone forgot tell people behind bar hundreds great bartenders Vegas looking jobs. people very rude no smile. Artisan beer really? Served horrible food? better beer food just walking place. wonderful food drink service all around them due fail. ahead try pay large rent poor service food. restaurant rare night impressed. atmosphere really loud definitely right place date night. Seriously could barely hear husband saying sitting right across me. many food options just side page menu prices little higher expecting. service great rarely saw waitress.

The theme restaurant well coordinated appreciated. menus look composition books napkins look lined paper along variety other cool themed decorations. hummus plate ordered very good but cocktails ordered terrible. couldn't even drink mine felt bad paid much something didn't enjoy. 

We having such bad time left appetizers food may amazing. However atmosphere limited variety meal options turned off. might try again but sure would worth it. Great family dinner Public school 702 last night. waitress Emily fantastic chef Jason amazing. Try watermelon heirloom tomato mozzarella platter. Never would put things together but delicious!! Loved service tonight! Katie great made fun night.  met all needs!!! tendency needy customer. Great weekend brunch!  enjoyed almost bottomless bloody marys stuffed french toast huntsman bacon burger YUMMY!  Wow service front door greeting fun server Ruth. school theme decorations fun create excellent atmosphere. eaten 4 times 4 different friends. conclusion reached back house food well run while front house wait bar staff not. 

Their menu creative food quite good. past ordered brussels sprouts salad shrimp grits salmon. food delivered timely manner. 

However staffing issues. server side think just short experienced servers. couple times did eat bar server trainee them. If restaurant succeeds should correct itself.

My criticism bar staff more problematic. exception nice fellow Simon boss bartender other staff condescending slow serve. felt if somehow did something wrong sitting losers table.  Las Vegas home world's best hospitality workers. Can't find people other people want them feel welcomed?  Each time restaurant similar experience. Managers wake up! nice cool school attitude percolating front house. Great food good service. Came first visit definitely inpressed. menu touch fancy but ask recommend item wont disappointed. 

Our server Sheri legit ask spell name thats only thing needed. Even frys good. Soda comes glass bottle coke which prefer made real sugar!  

The sauces specials house made tons good rotating beers draft. return company definitely struck gold manager Shaun!!! He visited table server messed order don't remember name anyway Shaun made right. He glowing personality made forget any issues... say very disappointed service received today. came dinner seated waited 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged there. Several servers staff including hostess sat walked without saying word. when server Carissa did come over told waiting 15 minutes she gave attitude just said ok confusion tables . she wasn't very nice either. placed order took another 10 minutes drinks. food came fairly quick sad say worth wait. seared scallop salad very bland. would asked more dressing but Carissa no where found. entire time she checked once she pleasant all even smiled. Such shame because atmosphere restaurant fun cute decor quite fun bar menu but don't feel back due horrible service received. many restaurants downtown summerlin would rather someplace where least act want business rude us. Dropped today grab Bloody Mary walked 9 47 place empty asked first person saw young guy black hair if open. He said opened 10 said well  only few minutes mind if seat inside heat. He told no leave. Well though pretty rude since only 11 minutes until opened point. seen enough place decided Distill celebration instead. No problems getting here! Good food better service.  Second time brown bag fries definite plus.  Tyler server just awesome would ask sit area next time definitely next time. bring new silverware when take appetizer plates away. Don't put silverware back your dirty placemats use again. isn't McDonald's.

Our server didn't even look when talking taking order. He watching something other side restaurant.  He rude condescending. 

The bartenders very nice made some good cocktails. liked players cup. 

Unfortunately server made visit Public School unpleasant experience. If could zero stars would because awful couldn't even comprehend customers. servers bartenders hell even managers didn't know left right Cabernet Chardonnay didn't even know whiskeys available. Let alone amount time took each drink app entrée come let tell timing between each encounter server order good 20 minutes. wouldn't mind long waiting time if ANYTHING even edible.
I'm wish failure upon anyone but amount space should towards  team stuff together. McDonald's could run better gastro pub love gastropubs thrilled find new opened five minutes house. Service great almost everything tried fantastic! favorites buffalo cauliflower vegetarian chili soup day . only complaint orange juice brunch extremely small filled ice no refills. only $3.50 trying fret but if you're parched Vegas heat would recommend ordering something else beermosa would better choice. high hopes alas case. Service extremely slow. Took least 15 minutes beer then beer flat. Took back bar tell them bartender tried tell nitro beer supposed way. beer before many times fact beer choice know should taste like. server nice enough take back take off check. Food ok. Missing some components sandwich menu but actual sandwich. Fries good. atmosphere decor but won't far if food bartender par. worst service ever had. boyfriend lunch. ten minute wait seated which no big deal. Then seated waited atleast 10 more minutes until server wasn't even section realized no even greeted taken drink order. She took drink order then actual server the receipt said name lauren showed few minutes later take drink order said someone else took it. She then took food order ccb no bun Brussel kale slaw. boyfriend chicken waffles Sunday brunch. She leaves put order then returns 10 minutes later asks everything going if ready order food. just looked confused said she already taken order. She said oh yeah then stares empty iced tea leaves. assumed she getting more. She then walking around almost looking she trying busy but really doing anything. food showed mine bun asked have. just took off. Both meals delicious. She did stop back though sure everything ok. Waited another 15 minutes until realized she isn't comin back asked another server more drinks. Then when finished meals she stopped twice see if wanted more drinks. Yeah now done eating she wants attentive? almost humorous absent she was.

*** someone public school messaged yelp appologized asked email further discuss. gave them boyfriends email. almost three days now never reached out. Same half ass service restaurant. Good happy hour specials. place extremely packed! enjoyed trying buffalo cauliflower first time. Jungle Juice amazing!! back! Good place crowd. excited try restaurant.  restaurant beautiful location great heard food pretty good but sadly mistaken.  disappointing visit started soon walked door... hostesses talking waiter corner looked way few times made eye contact but did stop conversation.  then thought maybe she wasn't hostess started walking into dinning area... saw some people but didn't know if hosts.  returned front stood few minutes.  hostess corner two other people walked dinning room all came over once?  Okay finally seated!  waitress never refilled drinks food salty overall good.

It just bad experience recommend eating here.  many better options Downtown Summerlin! Service extremely slow restaurant practically empty don't know why took long.  waitress seemed very indifferent needs work customer service skills.  Food ok great. Terrible! Three brunch yesterday. Two ordered edamame hummus breakfast. Both feeling unwell yesterday afternoon. sure wrong but couldn't keep anything down all last night. Co incidence two ordered same item both sick? your own determination guess. PS 702 number times experience beer selection. Understanding service usually terrible but Kaila your Las Vegas location took step further. Took roughly 15 min two drinks then took another 25 min meal my salmon came overdone 15 min before GFs poke came out . am used both entrees coming same time waitress giving attitude when asked issue occurred. Mark alleged manager very nice took drinks off bill but Kaila noticably rude throughout experience. Kaila epitome regards Las Vegas industry standards. no longer frequent location again. 

Lazy dogs Wolfgang Puck's next door never steered wrong though. week ago threw boyfriend surprise birthday party Public School. turned perfect!

I Public School before but somehow missed chef's table hiding behind wall. hostess escorted table all closest friends family jumped behind wall surprised him! Again perfect!

It nice know although all arrived server Emily taken care guests drinks appetizers. evening progresses everything came timely matter drinks constantly refilled until cut ourselves off manager forgot name even came over sure everything going well.

Thank entire staff made boyfriends birthday dinner remember! Just PEEFECT! P.S. favorite dish Banger Mash two grilled chicken herb sausages bacon brussels mash caramelized onions au jus. agree few others reviews LOUD! seriously need noise dampers. also very BJ's YardHouse Cheesecake Factory ish style menu. But feel food pretty good. Service sucks but  just Vegas esque. Nice happy hour menu beer menu changes weekly... overall fan. multiple times. Wish more TVs tho. Patio spring fall good time. Pretty cool spot bit yuppy ish sometimes.

Great spot first dates taken couple ladies there.
Never bad time.

The staff friendly younger.
Plenty tattoos piercings around.

Food innovative fun eat.
Beer selection outstanding such pub. great when opened but sadly gone downhill. Service beyond bad last few visits. waited 15 mins acknowledged last night another 15 mins bill said hurry! . guess would management issue servers fault. Food generally ok but wifes pizza last night all dried out. many good spots Summerlin waste time going back here. Sad lose old friend! excited try because location theme outdoor space. However weary because mixed reviews.  Friday night. said would 20 min but took 10 great. patio really nice look feel! excited! 
Then bad service. took server 10 15 min come take drink order took even longer actually drinks. water she said she'd bring didn't come until asked again halfway through meal.  ordered cheese plate which delicious drinks just good. bad would take forever every time ordered round. took even longer check seemed eternity cards back sign. 
With many other options chose why back place where don't respect customers enough provide efficient service? Great food. Terrible service.


When seated given menu look at. waited long time server come back take order. tried looking directly signal show ready order did see look back me. Also she walked table several times without stopping take order. pretty fed asked another worker if he could find server but he ahead just took order anyways Right ANOTHER server came introduced himself said server switching sections he taking over BUT still see server assisting tables right next mine. having switch sections but offended she started off left halfway without saying anything.

Our second server great attentive unlike first had. Public School gets decor A food. Hand Held Cobb solid piece I'd happy every time here. fries weakest link but only because there's nothing really different them. 

My only complaint ordered Diet Coke comes bottle which you're charged refills.

Sorry guys but majority your competition gives those away. $2.75 soda plus $1.50 refills...not good. heard great things restaurant until yesterday when coworker mine nothing but poor words spill. didn't let distract least trying it...

I'm glad did. probably won't back though.

Let tell why. restaurant big. big echo everyone talking feel you're cafeteria. big food while good ends cold if aren't next kitchen. big takes server five minutes side back.

...However some big flavors wouldn't shy away from. tots delicious sriracha ketchup add right kick compliment cheese bacon filling. chorizo mac n' cheese some great textures full bite everything showed dish could if piping hot . Jidori Chicken Waffles hit. hope use cornbread muffin some sort breakfast dish because I'd eat morning noon night.

I recommend trying Public School. lot look great beer selection short yet formidable cocktail list. new favorite restaurant Las Vegas. lived 5 months eaten several restaurants around town easily top 5.  Great service food ambiance. gin tonic housemade gin buffalo cauliflower.  Yowza.  back sooner later! 1st time public 702.  food good beet salad daughter stuffed french toast boys burgers...and glad see kids menu grandson.  Service ok...took bit refills but ok. Refills ice tea soda weren't free... $$$ soft drinks...Good atmosphere though probably try again. Came public school brunch two friends celebrating birthday... first off loved location decor. Super cute clever theme... atmosphere enjoyable. 
The service location amazing. host very sweet sat booth.
Our waitress Emilia amazing! Brought drinks quickly helped decided when ordering...
The food very tasty. vegetarian friend loved dish. She gave A+ Overall time spend public school much fun delicious. Thank you! looking forward restaurant opening months disappointed!!!!  waitress Vanessa very friendly knowledgeable beer well food.  Everything tried lamb burger fig prosciutto pizza ahi tacos amazing!  also children's menu chicken fingers delicious!  highly recommend restaurant.  Great food atmosphere!!! mixed reviews Public School 702. some stand dishes but also dull ones well. 

The Wild Mushroom Taleggio Pizza MUST! sold anything truffle oil if feel same highly suggest ordering this. can't wait back this! 

The Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower great well! Loved bleu cheese aioli sauce paired with.

Now moving things wouldn't order again. Speck Eggs weren't great. little salty if ask me. Also Ahi Tuna Poke tasted off. didn't think paired well passion fruit. If fruity tuna poke then maybe dish but wasn't me. 

Would back Public School 702? Yes! would back just pizza cauliflower. good! Other Public School 702 mediocre. If you're confused review told very top mixed reviews. wife friend dinner drinks. beer selection unique interesting tasty. deviled eggs your traditional Deviled eggs but we're very tasty. bacon cheddar tots God well. spaghetti shrimp grits both good well. bison burger bit disappointing. really impressed friend left leftovers behind waiter chased down outside give them her. He definitely above beyond impressed me. back. most ordered good but super salty  crispy buffalo cauliflower french fries mushroom pizza bbq burger moody burger. 

our server Mandy superb! Super cute inside. Food yummy. portions tiny much pay. sat bar. super friendly bartender rotated shifts friendly bartender. guess cancels out?  would back drink but grab dinner somewhere else. Good food good service very cute restaurant. more ask for?They good job public school motif.  Nice outside patio when cools down. Friday nights busy no problem.  party 2 inside check wait hostess mentioned would 20 25 minute wait gave phone number waited inside between rest rooms hostess stand.  30 minute mark guests came seated.  Hostesses saw still never said thing us.  40 minutes top wait time.  told hostess remove name she asked name removed it.
Service tip front door first experience guests when walk into restaurant.  Acknowledge your guests keep better track seated hasn't especially guests front your face 40 minutes advise guests longer wait time Friday night.  If seated earlier bonus your team!  If someone removes name wait your hostess ask if issue offer apology watching wait! say something!  Growing pains sure.
We won't back nor suggest friends family. Nice atmosphere moment walk door. Great view outside balcony! Great beer selection helpful knowledgeable staff. Nice menu several rotating selection beer well. Great addition Downtown Summerlin Sunday brunch... Awesome! Chicken waffles amazing well chicken sausage grits. Loved almost bottomless mimosas. Prices reasonable service great! Cool atmosphere. Definitely back again. Great concept downtown Summerlin midst several generic restaurants same old same old. 
       public school theme fun memorabilia walls around venue gives fun look into Las Vegas's local past. menu looked marble notebook cocktail napkin looked note passed classmate.               
        server Jared Smith gave great rundown menu explained beer selection really well. able sample quite few before making selections time left restaurant ordered almost all oft them. 
         would definitely recommend shrimp grits cauliflower delicious. Fun place craft beer good food reasonable prices fantastic service. back.  Cool place. Nice location. Nice draft beer list. Food solid. Short menu but well thought out. Better most restaurants price. Stopped Sunday some beer apps football. Good experience waiter cool always checking us. Overall good experience we'll back sure. Love new and much needed addition DT Summerlin.  visited 3x's week.  Food excellent craft beer menu very cool skilled bar tender shakes good martini.  BUT all ask turn down tunes.  point music loud leave diners bar visitors screaming each other.  If leave w headache won't remember good food is. Really great vibe... waitress Brittany helped ton..... Although did take suggestions... ordered amazing food.... fried cauliflower to die for.... Ask ginger aioli it.... bomb!!! That Brittany's suggestion working Nutella sandwich dessert... must now.... Wish luck!!! Horrible horrible horrible service. industry does matter amazing quality products if partnered customer service. entire experience ridiculous. moment walked in cold stoic hosts neglectful servers. forgot food drinks because felt interruption rather paying guest establishment. atmosphere very dull pretentious. could leaps bounds better but never returning never recommend establishment. Management needs think hiring process establish better standards guest service. Maybe then could educate target audience food beer . give couple years tops. place greatly reminds Rattlecan used Venetian great concept great products but cold unwelcoming staff atmosphere. epic fail waste invenstor's money. Vanessa incredible drinks amazing food great. flat iron steak mac n' cheese. 
Cancel four roses replaced Woodford lavender cocktail. 
Thanks Vanessa! Rachel best! Made feel home warm. always keep coming back. Woo. food always tasty paired good adult beverages! service friendly but alil slow. Also wait dressing side which took 10 minutes receive. Nice atmosphere ppl kinda bland but environment made seating very unique confy. food wasn't quite filling but enjoyed service atrocious.  food okay drinks delicious.  think time work kinks good concept just failed delivery. Love food! Love atmosphere! Super great place grab cocktails dinner chill patio friends. boyfriend dinner missed happy hour but good time. Good food kinda pricey. friends celebrate wife's birthday great experience. Service ok but food hot. appetizers entries everything room temperature warm food made sat around. Some dishes severely lacked basic seasoning form salt pepper chicken salad tasted cooked overcooked day before then shredded use next day. Kids chicken finger fried longer needed. seated near kitchen could tell no control food coming kitchen very undisciplined. before food much better months ago before started changing some plating food. No complaints bar side service side. did recognize some faults kitchen took off bill gave dessert share If could lower would... bar bartender rude acted he did favor... All staff acted above all patrons.. Over place!! Disgusting! Read all great reviews excited try approached door girl smoking RIGHT front door proceeded flick cigarette butt right front door while making eye contact she knew place. tile ground some dirty park. Bad first impression. first 2 tables tried sit covered leftover food. slow night if restaurant doesn't know serving 101 clean your tables guests leave no way trusted rest cleanliness. sat 5 mins still no cared wipe sanitize tables. back house must filthy if standard front house. Again slow night employees just standing around. walked out. Downtown Summerlin lot restaurant options sure sanitize clean guests. #1 Choice restaurants Downtown Summerlin! Fun spot offers great menu including BRUNCH! just Grilled Chicken Quinoa Salad...it's must have! Along Stuffed French Toast Chicken Waffles. service...is very friendly. wife wanted but kind skeptical.  thought just going pricier same stuff else where.  pretty unique stuff flavors amazing.  Fried Cauliflower doesn't sound good but amazing.  blown away it.  usually don't even cauliflower.  wife chicken waffles taste better other authentic southern restaurants.  hamburger but worth every penny.  Hamburgers everywhere but Superb hamburgers hard come by.  Even kids Mac N Cheese tasted amazing. Horrible food. Horrible service. Server rude bad attitude. place doesn't even ranch...... kind restaurant doesn't ranch ? big group lot different food appetizers everything disgusting. Ordered kids meal pasta daughter pasta still hard. Would never ever recommend place. Never ever coming back again. If could wouldn't give place any stars. today lunch buffalo cauliflower ahi poke Moroccan chicken club. Conner server he kicked ass. Super knowledgable beers gave really good feedback menu. If try place must drink Beer Camp phenomenal choice! Thanks Conner definitely coming back more ! eaten few times always pleased food. deducting star because without fail meal items always comes incorrectly regardless number people party. BUT we'll keep going back Saw waiter time ordering. Food ok die for. history once newness worn off! No supervision manager? Great food. Excellent presentation. Friendly service!

The bar always packed energy awesome but restaurant isn't which means aren't bringing enough servers accommodate group. such cool idea hope amp service because want love it. likely back well. Great food menu. Great beer wine menu. Absolutely terrible service. given three tries because cauliflower appetizer amazing...but every time gone back service worse time before. Very disappointing.

He last week hope he coming back. Love sitting outside patio. Very good wine prices too. favorite hangouts. Amazing food terrible service. first time excited try. hostess extremely rude start when told party 8. no expectation being seated right away sure where attitude came from. Once seated ordered some appetizers waters drinks. four times where all 8 empty glasses water ask someone bring more. never brought refill lemonade I think fresh lemonade missing ingredient ok dealing water without asking multiple times one. four appetizers never came track down waiter remind bring it. food came he never checked food or water . bison burger ordered medium well completely rare. picked around edges but barely eaten but sure didn't phase lazy waiter. When time 4 separate checks he pulled system can't bs literally write down per couple price each item add all include tax give tab end ring up. took 20 minutes write everything then computer magically rang separate checks. 

Now onto good food cauliflower buffalo appetizer favorite. also tried bacon cheese tots chorizo Mac n cheese calamari which all huge hit. steak truffle butter Mac n cheese. good size portion very tasty! husband bison burger which pretty good but also cooked properly. prosciutto pizza alright but little difficult eat because prosciutto cut into pieces chicken waffles great! appreciate family atmosphere Cheers chucks amazing food.

Beer specials good deal if available. Dearest Public School 702 want badly but your service sucks. should that. K tnx. Ericka. 

But real. love downtown summerlin its contemporary dining offerings keep getting drawn place. atmosphere fine interpretive modern take schoolhouse guess  point. 

The food little above 3 stars. flavors green chili chicken cornbread waffles threw off first but definitely left wanting more. Bacon cheddar tots total comfort food. Tried healthy time ordered kale Caesar salmon  salmon cooked well but dressing bland.

Service sucks super slow rude did mention they're super slow? food drinks decent when finally them but enough bring back. walk register pay check then walked over CPK where excellent friendly attentive service. Take notes Public School. Crispy cauliflower.  all need know.

Great cocktail craft beer selection well.

Live music patio games round perfect evening Vegas. previous review where walked received email corp office wanting talk experience. gave them email address never heard them.

Overall exceptional experience can't wait come back. boyfriend also super impressed eclectic beer menu. place Public School 702

Clean well lit equal parts natural light soft bulb illumination. staff great responsive place clean. Everything might expect place center newest place town Downtown Summerlin.

Food C.C.B Burger fries

The burger amazing every ingredient showcased ever bite. only issue burger crazy wet. Quite pool left hands sticky balsamic bun nearly disintegrated final bites.
The fries pretty standard design implementation but way compliment burger fantastic. Whatever did them work well mystery since appeared very normal fries.

Drinks Coffee milk stout Stone brewing

Excellent lightweight stout dark complexion dark chocolate finish pleasant every sip gulp. If Murphy's Guinness stout should put right where want be. food reasonably priced unique delicious is. amazing happy hour menu. Everyone works polite patient strangely attractive... love sitting outside because little loud inside especially music. Decent neighborhood place Summerlin. Convenient location. Food ok but limited menu. happy hour call recess great deal!


Explore cocktail menu extensive draft list! way happy! 

Great hidden treasure downtown Summerlin! food very good. Overpriced though. service horrible! ignored first 10 minutes when sat down. waitress never smiled once... looked all waiters zombies no emotion friendly all! hope management reads reviews take note your waiting staff sucks!! Just best dinner Vanessa V best.  She made great recommendations trainee still didn't miss beat. food absolutely amazing. birthday planned different place but immediately switched Public School eating once. food world beer selection amazing. recommend jidori chicken jalapeno cornbread waffles. sure ask Vanessa your server. She walked through extensive beer menu even provided samples recommendations. Best service ive ina  long time. tried wide range items menu nothing stood all. You'll notice most reviews staff decor yes service good decor theming outstanding. still restaurant though food sucked.

We didn't try any cocktails though... Maybe  where shine. Friday night.  Approached host stand quoted 40 minutes.  some thought decided put name down drink bar.  Keep mind almost left because long quote.

We sat down bar given menus immediately.  menus down attention away.  seemed staff behind bar more interested sampling beers draft servicing patrons.  finally asked if helped put order 2 glasses wine ordered cheese platter.  10 minutes bar texted table ready...??  definitely door needs help quoting parties accurately.  cancel cheese platter table outside.

The outside inside 2 different animals.  inside very loud reminded college bar atmosphere.  outside much quieter enjoyable.

We ordered cheese platter hummus platter chop salad.  All dishes great portions more enough.  server very friendly noticed wife another visit.  Only issue she spent much time chatting other tables hurt refills wine ordering process.

There seemed LOT staff restaurant.  All all loved food concept unique.  If given choice weather favorable patio booths. Jaimie friggin awesome!!! only second time experience phenomenal everyone carries genuine smile food amazing mimosas incredible! Jaimie thank taking care us! Great atmosphere great food reasonable prices. hip trendy place friends.

Went working lunch. bacon cheese tater tots deep fried cauliflower delicious. Sauce complemented both appetizers well. ordered Lamb burger cooked perfectly well seasoned. delicious. side salad little bitter blemish otherwise excellent meal.

Bottom line point back School. You'll glad did. would typically NEVER give 5 star review even if really impressed restaurant server but strongly feel place deserves it. Being beer lover stoked selection craft beers tap. server Colby like cheese lol very knowledgable food drinks sold Dawn Red brew really loved while chowed down ahi wanton tacos  also delicious. would never considered putting ahi crispy wonton but magic. Despite fact beer loyalist such interesting selection craft cocktails indulge while finishing meal. Colby said crushed velvet very popular gave try. Nice refreshing take Moscow mule. fresh lavender nice touch. can't wait back work way through great tap selection definitely ask Colby's section because never such great service casual concept. Came last minute date night wife.  cool casual vibe.  wait staff very attentive gave prompt service.  fiery calamari ahi tacos.  tacos sweet bitter contrast which nice.  Calamari spicy but good taste crispy.  wide selection beers.  Hawaiian beer refreshing.  

Over all perfect place chill love one.  Call ahead seat outside over looking fountains. Good service really good food!

I highly recommend chicken waffles! Terrible service.  told would hour eat outside 20 minute inside.  many tables both places. asked hostess problem she said short kitchen.  somewhere else. Public School twice.  service great food exceptional.  definitely back! food pretty good awesome citrus beer. But place truly special far best wait staff experienced Vegas.  Grace attentive knows menu backwards forwards certainly gives wonderful recommendations! Food good enough warrant return future. Service ok two stood few minutes when first arrived restaurant super busy but seated within 5 minutes. hamburger awesome. Ground chuck super tender juicy egg. Can't it. Beers little spendy side didn't ordered probably won't doing again. 8 bucks anyway. bacon cheddar tots really good don't even tell calorie count was! Don't need know! Wanted try place HH. Cauliflower over breaded unmemorable. Server charged regular price HH wine which %50 mark up. Asked other bartender fix tab which she did promptly. However ladies sitting next same problem being charged double drinks well. Server just blew off saying oh wanted happy hour? didn't say . Eh service. Ordered 3 appetizers them all separately. ask napkins. better service better food but drinks good. Really good food unique atmosphere! Brunch menu great three different dishes all excellent. Came again Happy Hour which great bargain! Try Gin Tonic drink because own tonic water which different but delicious! small plates edamame hummus Mac cheese tuna poke all super good. Note popular deck usually full. Love schoolhouse decor! Waitstaff great. came birthday family reservation greeted door said would minute. seated 5 minutes. trouble began 15 minutes later asked if helped. He took drink order never asked if wanted apps until drinks came.
After taking order apps took 35 minutes food come out. pizza came cold sent back. wife chicken waffles very good . son fish chips ok . pizza finally came same pizza warmed dry.

Would come back??? give another chance. place cute. literally school. theme carried throughout restaurant even down menu. Talk paying attention detail.

We meet fiancé's friends during afternoon New Year's Eve. restaurant baby  friendly provides steady high car children her baby 1 . 

We ordered decent amount food. cooked well plenty. price reasonable. ordered appetizer ate main course meal. calamari crispy naked wings great. enjoyed ahi tuna poke only place felt provided enough chips ahi tuna I usually ask more other places . highly recommend brussels spouts... never before but totally enjoyed it. 

Drink meal variety choices. ordered ace beer only beer could really drink. first time company holiday party. kind bummed because menu no vegan options. When waiter came take order said I'd eating since isn't vegan option he said he'd see if he could fix that. chef made wonderful poached pear salad arugula candied pecans. Then desert completely surprised delivered lovely poached pear sort taco fried pastry dough shell chocolate powdered sugar. first time having pears absolutely delicious. really appreciate them going far accommodate dietary preferences just entree but dessert really sweet them lucky such stellar chef! Many places nice modify recipe's vegan but pretty much none vegan dessert.

My coworkers really all loved meals especially buffalo cauliflower. Give place shot! atmosphere staff food wonderful. Food decent. Prices decent. Good beer. Ok mixed drink options. place right now.  Very friendly staff servers. ambiance really neat.  really all public school theme.  service really really slow. food ok but bad just amazing enough tell friends come check out.  might better spot meet drinks happy hour. Marilyn didn't know menu. ordered two things she came back corrections both times.  asked specifically if salad came romaine spring she said kale romaine.  She later came back say came shredded cabbage.  ended getting Salmon which good lite friend Chicken Waffles which different. bad though just ok. only appetizer once. usually come drinks. Nice patio. Just found brunch. favorite social eateries. If you're down pick off each others' plates then bring some friends order lot different items because most good. Tonight chorizo Mac n cheese pb j burger. burger AMAZING. Recommend sure. only give restaurant four stars because seated area without server. ready leave but server Tyler saved evening. restaurant gets four stars but Tyler gets five stars. section but he ensured wonderful meal! Fun place some different menu options... always seems very busy.... Service pretty good... 2 downfalls... #1 Music bar area being Rave loud last 3x left no voice trying speak over music... #2 don't seem enough glasses because served wine 5+ times hot glass fresh dishwasher... Glad clean but very good wine. Well found new favorite dining experience. buffalo cauliflower tater tots speck deviled egg chicken green chili waffle. awesome. now new way eat cauliflower. 
Sheena server really engaged knowledgeable. 
We actually came back today try other menu items. Labor Day. Expected crowded was. great thing Public School 702 its size. Even while busy today can't tell because tables spread nicely give appearance  bustling.

I've handful times since its opening never utterly disappointed food. just good bar food but does blazea trail culinary excellence originality. Service always seems start off little slow but due team service model once order food drink good clip.

That being said review weekend  brunch service. brunch menu more interesting regular menu enjoyed much more. Flavors bold serving sizes huge.  jidori chicken green chili cornbread waffles chicken sausage cheese grits. chicken waffles better interpretations classic dish. waffle more savory slight heat green chili offset some heaviness dish. chicken sausage grits good plentiful stuffed wilted kale cherry tomatoes topped over easy egg. menu didn't indicate would spicy but definitely some heat vegetable mixture which appreciated.  Paired grits very filling meal. would've appreciated biscuit some piece bread sop some sauce but then again may wear biscuit since full.

For those kids good place eat some grown food appease some kids' boring palates. kids menu standards mac cheese pizza chicken cheese burger sliders etc. Portions large a couple young kids could share pizza but cheapest kids' meals either. Noise level isn't much concern because there's always game shuffle board where banging pucks sound large wood planks slamming against each other. 

It's good choice whole family especially if you're walking around DT Summerlin. Cool inside dining if eating outdoors your thing nice patio but most view parking lot little water feature north end mall. 3rd time coming but there's new management night day difference. service much better drinks food came quickly tasted amazing. Lissie server just delightful come again great spot. decor reminded school days. Great food drink menu. really enjoyed spicy breaded cauliflower. Great view Summerlin Mall second story location. anxious back. only thing keeping getting five stars slow service. took forever  drinks  order placed. several orders each slow arriving. concept Public School but think needs fine tuned. food ok. tried half dinner menu I'd say favorite cheddar bacon tots buffalo cauliflower. pizza mediocre best wings chicken fingers extremely salty. favorite thing gotten Earl Grey Juniper cocktail gin based yummy! Aside those food service just average. didn't realize large chain....  happy hour specials good value... but food amazing just average . can't seat party 10 because silverware? 
But seat next two groups 4?
Give better excuse next time. Great find. salmon entree. best cooked dishes tasted. edamame hummus flatbread fantastic. menu fresh great selection beers rotating list tap food good decor fun unique but stood most customer service. two beers two appetizers beer little late appetizer 30 min late . didn't complain but when server realized happened she immediately sent manager over came sure having ok time. then he comped entire bill even asked server offer free dessert. declined impressed efforts made situation right. place won't dissatisfied with. Public School downtown summerlin some friends Saturday night great time. place huge! decorated old public school relics definitely some interesting history pieces Las Vegas well. sat ourselves bar which open seating great since didn't wait. server comical energetic gentlemen named Jared. Great personality server. craft beer menu daunting but he some samples recommendations all found something liked. ordered food family style could all try everything. ordered tots Mac cheese pepperoni pizza Tuscan salad. Everything awesome came staggered we're able try all hot fresh. would tried cookie sandwich but stuffed. Well come back try next time well definitely back. If you're going see if Jared's working. He said two them though ask Jared Smithe. Amazing breakfast even better service Jordann! She made sure food good consistently filled bottomless mimosas highly recommend! Christian bartender he absolutely amazing !! We're super indecisive he able some delicious shots. 
This place changed since first opened love now. new Gm very pleasant well stopped cute little girlfriend Kim because she being hungry little baby beyond expectation.  business gave off similar vibe other public house themed pub bar but better tasting food better quality cocktails more interesting theme others.  expected something Yardbird but much better.  bartender Kallie proficient mixology. Well done. would definitely come back next time mall. 

If something bothered fact TV channel surgeries nasty kind. Puss popping liposuction. Disgusting choice place serves food.  little baby run away bathroom while all patrons screaming.  gave four stars Kim said unforgiving restaurant such mistakes. would change review if no such thing occurs next time. cool place. just drinks but great selection craft beers tap.  second story patio great nice day overcast day ton shade.  food looked incredible. Sunday brunch menu small food adequate but spectacular. Great selections beers drinks. Loud service slow.  someplace would back to. great experience very beginning when greeted many smiles! entire staff friendly accommodating food delicious everything ordered perfection! Love vibe awesome view outside night also!
My daughter picked birthday dinner glad she did we'll definitely back Wished would gotten names server host other staff could commend them wonderful experience Thanks Much Public School 702!!!! Amazing food. Amazing Service. Great ambience! Try buffalo cauliflower! Vegan options bonus! eat if want able converse others your table. club loud there. sure why that. scream communicate anyone. never come back because actually interact dining companions. Food ok. Service barely acceptable. place seriously legitimate.

Outside Patio Beer Pong
Shrimp Grits die over
Cool atmosphere!
Downtown summerlin!

This place ALL! Being frequent visitor Downtown Summerlin Sephora....need say more? when first noticed place boyfriend decided needed eat ASAP. came Friday around 5 45 happy hour. packed told happy hour bar area outside patio. chose latter. wasn't hot each booth fan. absolutely LOVE theme restaurant. menus look old school composition notebooks. managers walk around dressed teachers  mean adorable. 

When sat down took while server come over ask drinks but super busy wasn't big deal. time he came over already knew wanted order happy hour menu which really good choices! put food order well. 

My boyfriends beer came first 10 minutes later finally received drink. ordered crushed velvet which spin classic Moscow Mule. REALLY good much drinker. distinct flavors blackberry lavender. Super yummy. 

Our food came pretty quickly. one. ordered speck eggs which really good! ahi street tacos also good. farro Brussels sprouts salad wasn't all great only because kind thing. receiving all plates server another table. decided almost immediately wanted order couple more things before happy hour over at 6 30 . looked phone saw 6 10 so. knew server would back before 6 30 wasn't worried. Also side note when first plate boyfriend ordered another beer. 

But here's thing...our server didn't come back. check see if liked food drop off boyfriends beer. Nothing. Finally another server runner brought beer....20 min later. Yep. 20 MINUTES! What?  just nuts. 

So 6 10 6 28 waited server come back could order more happy hour menu. Finally he came told we'd order more beer another dish happy hour menu PB J sliders something off happy hour menu shrimp grits . which he responded... well happy hour actually over right now. But try see if in. responded but only 6 28. thought happy hour ended 6 30. he replied same thing try . didn't bother telling if he come back check before 18 minutes...we could've put order sooner. knew if he couldn't then going speak manager. 

So he left table table directly across where group women eating ordered happy hour menu. He told them same thing happy hour over but he'd try like he's doing all favor. __ said didn't want say. Well wanted order sooner but couldn't find you. never came table again. If can't I'd speak manager. He replied try . 

Alas all food happy hour prices bomb. server SUPER nice guy. He just needs work spot checking tables more often. 

I say shrimp grits delicious but star show PB J sliders. weren't expecting them mind blowing revelation. But were. beef patty crunchy peanut butter habanero jelly. DIVINE. if you've made far into review I applaud you. take away only thing please let ORDER PB J SLIDERS. 

Carry fellow Yelpers. place never disappoints. pepperoni pizza jalapeño pepper best addition pizza. little leery first but fantastic! service atmosphere perfect. Great locations coz downtown summerlin but felling restaurant close down few months. place ok inviting. Music good cozy guess! food ok calamari salty meatballs good linguine told spicy said ok but flavoring consistency food does well much spicy. Cute coke bottle drink fried chicken waffles OK tasted better! Dessert ordinary simple. all all nothing look forward don't even beers most alcoholic drinks beer wine wish fruity mixed drinks option!! gave 2 stars location. probably back until upgrade menu music restaurant good experiences but ordered food today online.  Asked them put bacon something came bacon.  just gave away can't eat it.  Contacted restaurant gave delivery service bs answer getting request but being able it.  Because putting ingredient evidently complicated.  many people dietary restrictions food allergies should inform people when don't want something.  Very disappointing. Great space cool atmosphere bit slow service horrible bar service. Red haired girl bartender flipping slow ridiculous...almost leave. even close being busy night. Each time ordered drink took FOREVER it.  sure order two beers time.   Music outside loud which only nice thingabout it DJ'S suck...choice music terrible.The booths outside attract bugs due hanging lights above table really nasty would never eat outside night evensit booth beer. need figure bug issue big time. being said would back mushroom pizza all day long really good pizza just expect bad bar service eat inside. Initially impressed modern Decor sadly where stopped. made reservations through yelp some sort corporate issue website no reservation even though received confirmation. brought guests town try new restaurant expecting amazing. Everyone disliked food. Including myself. bland tasting  worth trip downtown Summerlin.  Perhaps unrefined pallet would find delicious. great place incredible meal relaxed atmosphere fantastic view
Michele server wonderful fit entire atmosphere 
Have found new favorite place eat can't wait return try all appetizers don't forget deserts. main menu diverse everyone find something eat party 4 Saturday night. place very cool decor sticks school theme. menus cool looked composition books. sat communal dining area because 45 minute wait private tables bar full. waitress very friendly however waiting drinks forever. ordered steak salad friends burger. atmosphere social but music loudness everyone's conversation definitely clashing. friend's food 5 minutes before us... thought very unprofessional telling friends ahead start eating felt awkward eating front us. ordered medium well both burger steak salad when food both cuts meat very pink. almost sent steak salad back but knew would take even longer already waiting while. salad lacked flavor ended asking lemons vinegar season myself. would still again but would choose something else menu order well done avoid having almost still mooing cow delivered plate. Jamie awesome ! Thanks great suggestions ! We'll back again sure ! place generally good. only things  complain sort half upscale sports bar half casual fine dining sort weird but works them. Also because half sports bar atmosphere tvs which play sport loud people screaming tvs gets extremely obnoxious especially since paying $60 $120 meal there. pricing NO WAY line atmosphere crated. Although theme cool give them that. 

 think food good but overpriced sure probably because downtown summerlin but I'd say definitely worth trying prepared meal two least $60  minimum. salmon succotash good but bit lemony taste said grilled though more blackened but maybe definition grilled different. finished meal. paired red wine cabernet which nicely salmon. 

My boyfriend huntsman burger which he enjoyed but he said ketchup came weird spicy taste mine tried burger tasted good seasoned well not $20worth though All all its good but no better yard house something way pricier too. Good food. Good ambience. Amazing server! Thank Elizabeth making first visit Public School wonderful one. They're lucky you! Met some friends together. Michael server. Thai Noodle Salad crispy calimari. Very tasty. bring husband next time. Public School 702 always great place quick bite dinner enjoy few beers. also Public School 818 213 805. menu pretty standard but sometimes switch things up. kids menu great portions quite generous. Brussel Sprouts amazing! food good but soda comes glass bottles no refills. Diet Coke bottle mini bottle while Coke regular size same price. When complained gave free Diet Coke but just aware bottles no refills. food pretty tasty. Dragoon Short Rib over priced. bartenders all KUHL. going back sure.  approve message JK KUHL... Fun decor but very loud.  Buffalo cauliflower good but salmon over cooked dry served fresh vegetables. again. incredibly hot day lunch. really loud inside opted eat patio despite heat.

The gluten free menu available upon request extensive. But only real complaint. food excellent. ordered steak tacos lettuce husband salmon. Both good. wasn't asked preference steak but would say medium well cooked.

If averse noise am would recommend going when less hot outside. misters going but still pretty hot. fans unfortunately order but told fixed soon. Perhaps update if return. But limited gluten free menu won't want back while. decision eat best Las Vegas decision ever made. server sister Katie knowledgable every item wasn't afraid recommendations based looking for. Just real sister except even related. 

Lauren also stopped table some drink recommendations helped decide which dessert choose ask apply Nutella....it's treat. 

I'll back friends sure. Oh try steak Mac Cheese. Let start saying eaten several times. while no meal ever perfect some definitely better others. When service great food mediocre. When food awesome service lacked ultimately think service general leaves alot desired. past few times dined weren't greeted promptly wait unusual amount time drinks left without refills entire meal food solid three star rating. favorites menu buffalo cauliflower charcutterie platter which consistently good. chicken waffles however consistently bland sometimes downright bad. fish chips safe choice usually pretty good. burgers always hit miss just tonight ordered shorty bowl which pretty good but egg cold cold runny egg yolk favorite far.

I want place better point given cost entrees lackluster food service feels staff just doesn't care don't think rotation any more. very cool atmosphere brings back school . Happy hour menu good . beer variety great different flavors great taste. tried fried broccoli great flavor. Also tried sliders happy hour menu really nice flavor. spicy ketchup plus! came today Happy hour.  Happy hour prices fair. HH beer $1 2 off select pints. Beer selection good but necessarily HH price ! HH food still pricey side opinion. HH Ahi Tuna Fish Tacos $7 4 smaller average street tacos taste decent. HH chicken wings $6 very good worth it! 

HH Chorizo Mac Cheese $7 normal $10 . TERRIBLE! WORST MAC Cheese ever. Cheese runny bland thinned milk. served cast iron dish but some cheese still runny did forget bake it?! Chorizo Spanish style cured expecting Mexican style but menu doesn't clarify. Salt Vinegar lays potato chips top added crunch but fully crumbled made dish difficult eat. Kale added pretend dish healthy but does nothing taste. 

Our server Mark great truly understanding helpful. 
My recommendation place beer atmosphere only! Food so so but pricey. Great spot brunch. Handel crowd trust table 9 able handle easily no wait. waitresses super nice very informative menu best way utilize Bottomless drinks 
Had great time can't wait until next weekend Lovely restaurant friendly staff. waiter Julian best part experience. Everything service top notch. Now let's food. Extremely disappointing. carving board above average. disappointed selection. Fried calamari ?? Wow. worst ever had. Dry .. sauce sub par. When requested marinara arrived ice cold zero flavor. $12 received $1 worth product. Three ordered each dish just ok. poblano peppers rice. Just ok. friends shrimp white cheddar grits fish chips. Well .. think nice plump shrimps would way medium sized average shrimps. fish chips ... really greasy while breading extremely larger piece fish. Very disappointing. thrilled Pinot Noir selection. Looks girls night needs find new place spend $150 plus tip. really liked place very first days. enjoyed unique food combinations tried lot! service very friendly accommodating. 

My favorite thing them very large patio. spots beer pong oversized Jenga oversized Connect Four. where located also. Hopefully well! Attached photo beer pong area. would love give restaurant 5 stars because only love food beer selection love atmosphere. But gone three different occasions rude rude rude extremely rude service. only server but bartender manager. definitely start logging names because employee service industry myself can't believe entitled employees when customer isn't happy meal just asking questions. fiancé myself manager laugh faces when question regarding menu wanted price adjusted based described.
There really needs little customer service training all employees managers. Employees guest customers alike need understand quality customer service comes quality customers severs. hope sooner later quality service changes because actually great place great location especially such shitty service managers!!! Pounding club music tattooed hipsters marginal food. restaurant caters 10 years behind San Francisco scene.  Looooong wait over hour bartenders scan section but rather focus sitting directly front them. During busy service scan your section check drinks serve anyone looks need service then hustle! Wouldn't back. really love place  quite few times always great food great service. Tonight no exception  server Rachael!  She sweet efficient. She handled many requests no problem sincere service. She checked light meal everything right!  
We definitely back hope Rachael again! customer service horrible. sat down bar bartender handed menu half items expired. ended getting Jack coke bartender filled portion shot ran Jack while half filled didn't bother opening new bottle strictly coke. sat down received water vase distribute table ourselves. received second bottle noticed lot food floating around bottle. already drank half bottle! brought server he responded let another one. expressed disgust happened he said he would talk manager. Once he returned clean bottle asked manager said he responded he didn't say much . appalled! manager then finally came asked would do? pulling teeth good service. only reason giving star because took 20% off bill. Over all food OK menu confusing entire table ordered same thing. careful. Stopped dinner again. love cutting board mushroom pizza! Perectly cooked service amazing! Wasn't fan smoke watermelon but replaced crushed velvet. Super awesome! love back soon! Bartender nice helpful but almost every time come certain beers something discontinued.  bartender recommended two beers then came back said lol.  No surprise anymore.  main complaint.  However thanks putting PB J sliders back menu amen! great dinner last Friday night family. Tyler server he did fantastic job. party 11 4 little kids Tyler handled well. recommendation Huntsman's burger spot on. Very tasty. chorizo Mac cheese awesome too. just wish more IPAs tap. Great atmosphere. Love recess hour especially recommendations awesome server Vanessa! Love truffle fries ahi tuna tacos. Came happy hour dead. Bartender zero personality attentiveness. Only reason giving place 2 stars because beer list. place breath fresh air Vegas. Great happy hour rotating beer menu interesting flavor combinations. 

Our service fantastic. Tyler made sure drinks filled food came super fast. gobbled up. 

Happy hour prices top notch. highly recommend crispy cauliflower Parmesan truffle frites. 

In main menu also enjoyed Cutting Board meat cheese selections. 

I don't know where find all bearded hotties but it. atmosphere cool classic. best place watch big game considering aren't many TV's. food drink basic boring way overpriced. staff friendly took care us. Overall experience lame Just amazing dinner 2 friends.  waiter Noah amazing.  Everything he suggest absolutely mouth watering beer food he worked accommodate friends special dietary needs. Frito pie bangers mash Jidori chicken deviled eggs appetizer.  patio beautiful. Can't wait bring family town coworkers here!!!  Keep good work!!! Ok few times meeting friends etc always same experience... Terrible service. completely disorganized most servers attitude doing favor. Summary avoid place unless absolutely necessary. lots great options nearby. Valerie made night best night ever server. Very going most personable server had. Food great draughts point Nothing jumped while eating here. food average servers attentive. atmosphere furniture wicked though. bad spot stop lunch! Great new restaurant Downtown Summerlin. Food good nice craft beer list unique spins traditional cocktail. atmosphere inside fun beer pong big jenga shuffleboard TVs. Service little slow times if sit bar loud. Cool atmosphere.

Waiter looked Sam Smith kind annoying. Kept coming table trying rush purchase more cocktails. could understand if full house wanted turn table ASAP but half empty dude. Relax.

I ordered Cauliflower Buffalo bites which very delicious. Crispy hot tasty dipping sauces. also Grapevine cocktail which also point.

I would return some point and or recommend it. Public School attention. Parmesan Truffle Fries Margherita Pizza PB J Sliders Chorizo Mac n Cheese. 

Walking louder expected be. Classic cafeteria chatter echoing throughout. didn't best job explaining where sit but wandering caught eye someone ended being helpful. Friends atmosphere which grew us. 

The pizza least favorite luckily also last. quite sure if simply because paled comparison everything ahead it. PB J sliders must! habanero jam it! Chorizo Mac n Cheese good vinegar crunch best touch. texture chorizo set off bit... tough chewy. sure if just ours but good enough back try again!

We also Dawn Red Ninkasi Brewing Co slight hints pineapple mango papaya. adventure your taste buds!

I assignment check Happy Hour Items only but eyeing watermelon dish update w name later.

Overall good time good taste. Atmosphere gives something automatically talk love Mac cheese. haven't while bad Julian doesn't work anymore. Alexis amazing server outstanding work! Jordan cool very getting! server Amberlyn made experience great when little thrown off menu changes manager Vinny came over immediately address course pitch all new amazing stuff! Thanks guys see soon! Visited new spot last night beers buddies really excited see variety menu some new craft beers authentic cocktail mixes unique public school fabulous views downtown summerlin. sat inside because muggy hot night but once cools down patio nice chill spot hang out!!

The Cutting Board very generous sized charcuterie board tasty selection meats cheeses. board large enough entire party try. 

Entrees Shrimp Grits favorite plates night! ton flavor nice portion.
Short Rib tender paired horseradish mashed potatoes.
Flat Iron Steak w Truffle Butter love anything truffle but didn't really taste it. plate did come chorizo mac cheese which highlight night! 
Jidori Chicken Waffles entire dish flavorful! chicken juicy cooked perfectly. 
Lamb Bolognese least favorite dish night... Don't order try above entrees instead! 

I definitely return! Maybe brunch!?!! service isn't great pretty noisy restaurant. food looks hopeful menu but taste doesn't deliver. Its overrated opinion more trendy anything else. eat Crave often always see restaurant  above. Today decided come try bf. came around 12 Saturday seated right away. Pretty busy but waiter Zo very attentive friendly. He gave thorough overview menu. chose truffle steak because truffle anything addicted!!! I'd probably willing eat crickets if truffle soaked. Anyway bf orders pepperoni pizza disappointed because doesn't sound exotic. When arrives looks delicious no longer upset him. truffle salad looks amazing but let down because really hardly taste truffle pizza amazing. Though! Simple very impressive!! can't wait eat again! school theme fun cute. loved table outlet USB plug my phone happened dying great .  server Zo blew away knowledge menu first time eating here. He also made fun quiz questions which tied whole theme restaurant. ordered mezze plate chicken sandwich adobo tacos soda glass wine the Tempranilla . Everything tasted amazing filling did take long come ordering. grand total $46 which super decent everything ordered. meal Zo took time tell happy hour brunch menus which can't wait come back try. eaten places similar menu less but theme decor service really sets place apart. Genuinely disappointed place. Came HH sat patio. sat low tops brown circle chairs. Very  uncomfortable. sat down 6 30 HH almost over. wasn't very busy all. ready order basically right when sat down. waitress introduced herself Courtney. She came off very sweet but wasn't great. ordered truffle fries calamari Margherita pizza tuna poke. calamari came really quick. Less 5 minutes ordered out. great! aioli calamari itself amazing. starting dish expected rest food great. More 10 minutes later truffle fries came out. HORRIBLE. loveeeee anything truffle. Truffle oil white black truffle truffle aioli basically anything truffle. no flavor lemon aioli horrible top off even remotely hot. waitress didn't stop back check while weren't able let know. pizza followed couple minutes later good. Nothing spectacular but bad. Finally once done calamari pizza poke came out. Very surprised took over 25 minutes receive. looked pre made all cooks would would scoop put bowl grab some chips put plate. wasn't bad passion fruit gave odd but unique flavor. 

Overall very disappointing experience. higher expectations food service. it. If busy know table all time but would've nice if she did quality check once food. busy all. Especially HH business. ready before even poke. assumed she forgot ring since took long. took two bites poke asked check could leave. 

Did see manager present venue but hostess blue dress boots very sweet sold restaurant. 

With many options DT Summerlin might stop grab cocktail bar but dining in. Want take break away strip come here!  greeted smile seated immediately comfortable booth. nice selection beers give small taste if can't decide.  During brunch Saturday $4 beers making even better! 

I steak salad which Delicious!  steak tender cooked medium rare way it. salad both red yellow beets making tasty healthy.  good didn't realize until ate all bacon left off. told waitress she nice offered free dessert!  son burger which huge juicy. came fries which also delicious.  He said he would again. 

We decided try ice cream sandwich made chocolate chip cookies.  large enough share.  yummy!  Then nice waitress Katie surprised banana pudding jar. She said try she right. smooth creamy made vanilla wafers. May best banana pudding ever had!

The place clean plenty seating both inside out. sit outside next time when bit warmer.  love menu made look old composition notebook past. decor wonderful old Worldbook Encyclopedias huge bookcase.  more things menu would try more beers drink! back! really liked place. yesterday afternoon brunch old new friends. 6 sat area restaurant wasn't crowded enough elbow room table comfortable. service good she able accommodate 6 different orders. sausage grits which very interesting because grits loaf somewhat country time grits style used to. corn bacon sausage kale tomatoes eggs loaf came together nicely. 

I changed egg fried scrambled because no matter hard try fried egg just doesn't work taste buds. almost bottomless good deal choose 4 drinks individually 4 same drinks $10. bloody mary came chicken wing which actually wasn't ready slightly confused but gave nice kick. Overall great place meet friends couple drinks eat good food. food good service great but washing dishes?!?!? Every time gone plate glass silverware dirty. but ask boxes plastic ware. really wanted love place. live near downtown summerlin excited try new restaurant. Sadly place beyond disappointing but considering still working getting kinks may back.

Positives 1 great setting fun ambiance great outdoor space games fairly large space seated quickly.

2 Variety interesting food drink selections menu good price good happy hour offerings

3 ahi tacos calamari great. blueberry lavender drink tasty but did come sprig lavender pictured. Think needed more lavender.

Negatives 1 ordered ahi tuna tacos appetizer menu asked tacos slaw salad ordered side come together entree. taco came first even before appetizer ordered salad came way later.

2 husband ordered burger medium. came literally raw! could made sick. made new took off check.

3 ordered Nutella Ice Cream sandwich reading all great reviews. WAX PAPER cookie which used put ice cream sandwich. Additionally cookie extremely hard inedible. 

4 manager came talk only food critic seated next told bad experience had. only problem server did tell manager come talk received poor quality food. talked manager did seem very apologetic but did give card if wanted come back. should comped meal based experience but alas no offers. 

I am understanding restaurant new. Unlike Lazy Dog which around corner trained staff two weeks prior opening Public School 702 seems lacking food service. am hoping worked future. stated above its great spot shame if things don't pick up. only here! Public school indeed cafeteria food. 
This review being written person comes food beverage background. 

Pros restuarant aesthetically pleasing. seated promptly hostess friendly. 

Cons last night dinner while crowded couldn't understand why. server unbelievably rude. wish gotten name but she never introduced herself. She seemed fine first but managed bad side. She served luke warm water I'm sure if  thing but prefer water cold . asked cold water she seemed irritated but thought maybe reading wrong brushed off. ordered food. Appetizers calamari wings. father steak tacos boyfriend bison burger medium rare ordered fish chips. apps okay probably best part meal. fish overcooked old oil fries tasted frozen. told server quality fish wasn't good because old oil response okay . Uh No? Im paying quality food right? asked take back if possible another item menu steak tacos . tacos mediocre. tortilla tasted old but steak cooked well. Now burger. well done. When server came ask everything stated burger well done medium rare. supposed she just took statement because she didn't care anything apologize. now end meal manager comes over apologize fish chips. explained wrong excuse didn't executive chef su chef back therefore food isn't consistent. Did she really just throw restuarant under bus? Okay lol. bill came $100 some change 2 apps 3 entrees 4 beers. bad but worth quality honest. service slow she gave attitude every request. originally going give 15% tip even bad experience because hey she didn't cook food but changed 10% when she gave dirty look scofted left. Terrible experience. Train your servers over customer service. someone expedite food. Train your manager pacify complaint without throwing restuarant under. 

Would 1 star but gave them 2 stars atmosphere apps friendly hostess. Great food friendly service. waited age mains come restaurant wasn't busy. only ordered salads sure hold was. would still recommend. Back again! live Henderson Public School destination us. being said if I we lived closer could become issue server Sherrie just coincidence she polite knows menu checks back your food arrives She just knows job functions which basic sounds many perfection can't imagine coming ordering Buffalo Cauliflower Speck Eggs would feel cheated 2 items consistent DEEELISH mention remarkable!!!!
    Today ordered Grilled Watermelon Tomato stack  feta cheese mint basalmic glaze Beautifully presented I posted pic very delicious tastes. am feta  however feta thinly sliced complemented watermelon perfectly addition some nuts plate garnish supplied needed crunch would missing casual spot seating outdoors both lovely However warn loud IF your looking quiet good choice especially 5 when bar filling up. Conversation table lunch fine sparsely full. first time beautiful Monday evening.  location fairly easy find especially given never before.  busy but jam packed atmosphere slightly upscale yet relaxing.  didn't feel place walking into restaurant party only wait five minutes bar before being seated outside.

The patio great place sit talk while noshing some apps drinking some specialty beers.  selection beers plenty fine liking both hostess sat server waited kind attentive.  only qualm food ordered seemed little sub par price point paid.  no issue spending money good food indulgences  completely worth it.  But Tuna lacked flavor calamari seemed touch overdone.  

Still though only appetizers would more willing back once again give some entrees try see there.  fun little place just right combination fun classy book. pretty disappointed yesterday because past some amazing experiences. poured whole bottle wine every single glass water waited waited waited. Short staffed? Probably but  really proper solution deal delt over 2 hours. But Ill cut them break because food always amazing hahaha! stop Chorizo mac cheese world! heard lot great things Public School 702 say did disappoint. venue itself wonderful theme. There's memorabilia all over restaurant generations different schools. bar area reminiscent gymnasium bleachers scoreboard. There's also shuffleboard beer pong extremely large Jenga. Right off bat impressed.

We greeted promptly server Jared Smith. He gave tour menu over craft beer list. 40 them! He recommended crushed velvet much beer drinker tenaya brown husband is. crushed velvet delicious! blackberry Moscow mule. Next ordered mezze plate crispy cauliflower based Jared's recommendations both delicious.

For dinner ordered salmon succotash husband fried chicken waffles also Jared's recommendations. salmon fresh paired delightfully succotash. combination crushed velvet salmon good order another one. husband raved dish course tried yes delicious. bit many calories but if  no concern and husband then dish you!

All all great experience bill extremely reasonable. atmosphere light fun food beverage delightful. very impressed Jared recommendations. loved everything he picked he made experience even more enjoyable. Public school definitely back! decor service awesome. during brunch. $4 draught beers. smothered burrito. Looks fancy much but its tasty filling. Solid. am really fan place given three tries because all reviews seem love it. Let tell overhyped. beer okay best food really mediocre. couldn't find anything looked good menu food took long come. would say come food. ambiance pretty because drinks okay could understand why people patronize place. But those just want come food dont waste your time. Kristina very nice bartender great cocktails  trendy spot open floor plan creates great open ambience love pizza! place looks classroom cafeteria. host recommended deep fried cauliflower delicious! appetizers only cider. waitress equally nice talkative when asked questions menu. Most employees very friendly smiled when talked to. 

I plan coming back visit again. seems good place drinks hangout some friends. place would five stars but there's something missing visit. Maybe should tried dessert? Atmosphere alright. Food so so. However buffalo cauliflower super good!! Drinks good. only select few beers all craft. Service pretty good. Probably wouldn't come back nothing want choose place over other bajillion bars amazing places eat Vegas. am sad report second visit amazing first. really hope just off night Public School 702 because really love ambiance live music weekend nights. 

I feeling pasta meaty red sauce ordered bolognese. But very strange flavor atypical meat sauce. think only reason ate without complaint due utter mortifying food experience all around bad day friend having.

The chef made things right though making off menu light salad. poached pears mixed greens prosciutto salad topped candied pecans goat cheese really really good!! would come back just salad.

For dessert lemon meringue graham cracker bottom. dessert looked absolutely scrumptious. meringue super good but lemon custard way sweet palate. cut sweetness between sips dark roast otherwise bitter coffee.

The restaurant clean staff friendly. Because two experiences very different another am sure come another visit near future. dinner Saturday evening. pretty quick we didn't reservation understand called public school tables chairs probably more uncomfortable actual public school. fan cold hard metal chairs. really loud too. Having said food really awesome. buffalo cauliflower bites really good. Beer selection good too. pricy very ok ambiance. $9 kids meal steep. Root beer. Wine glass pricy starts $9.. Pinot Grigio. Looks lot things. server Melissa terrible rude slow. OMG introduced new entree brunch menu. Pecan crusted french toast indescribable. sweet but grilled peach sweet cheese amazing finish plate. love chefs use creative  imagination depth palate such dish. Two thumbs up!! am looking forward winter menu. Matt waiter he made brunch blast. He attentive ball everything needed. He really enjoys job new home Las Vegas. say PS702? always great time here! food drinks service.... always point! especially love brunch... What's eggs Benedict pizza stuffed French toast? always best selection craft beers! Every time something new taste! most times educated see did there? Lol new beer haven't even heard of. Also fun night live music! Last time performers Voice!!!! yourself favor check out!!!! won't disappoint! cocktails pretty good however food just blah. staff friendly attentive. wish better happy but definitely would come back drinks. wife came brunch very happy chose place. just bottomless brunch beverages mix match seriously point. decided start calamari appetizer but told server fans mayo based sauces. She told chef he sent three different sauces calamari all tasted amazing. Roos chef being accommodating. chicken sausage grits wife roasted veggie hash tostadas Adobe sauce. grits super creamy cheesy sauce vegetables fantastic texture variance made dish good. roasted veggie hash great freshness subtle earthy favors enchanted brilliantly Adobe sauce. most definitely back. would loved try place however seated last night 20 minutes without much someone even telling they'd over take drink orders. completely ignored left love place! Conner awesome bartender he knows all brews back hand.  Brandon pretty darn cool too. bison burger cooler both them. back!! Service walked hostess doesn't even greet us. look through crowd entrance determine was. hostess front looking straight down tablet seating. approach order initiate any kind conversation.

Service sat down ok. Just sure order need when see server takes minute them you.

Food read review below indicated nothing really stood out. agree review. Nothing really stood which necessarily bad but also good. Restaurants need specific dish two stand guests think want again! Watermelon tomato appetizer mediocre. places able use balsamic dressing complement sweetness watermelons perfectly. believe trying much dressing. yellow tomato kind confusing. first piece girlfriend bland second piece bottom more flavor. 

Charcuterie board nothing really special. would prefer down street hearthstone better selection.

Chicken waffles also missing something. Perhaps thick cut bacon never does me. more crispy bacon kind person. bacon made gravy really chunky appealing could been. corn bread waffle could use extra minute waffle iron. serve chicken top waffle slightly covered gravy extra side same gravy. would recommend getting gravy side your fried chicken doesn't soggy. 3rd time eating last.  1rst time decent experience 2nd time awful experience 3rd time repeat 2nd.  

The last 2 times very consistent though.  Slow indifferent wait staff undercooked food frigid  ambient air.  sure bring Parka management likes keep temp point see your breath.  addition if lucky placed tables uncomfortable aluminum chairs extra chill literally seat your pants.  

Service very slow last 2 visits even when aren't busy impression restaurant already outgrew new coolness but some reason continued feel special thus open suggestions impression upper management likely feel customers continue return no matter experience feels very reminiscent restaurants 80s felt big bad refused change thus nothing but memory internet search pages under top ten 80's chain restaurants failed 80s Nothing changed between 2nd 3rd visits spaced 4 months apart usually means nothing will.  

I unfortunately recommend Public House anyone lives visiting Vegas many better options staff care act thing lucky sitting well food taste better better price.  menu tries original choices but comes off being bland flavorless.  

I always give place 3 chances unfortunately 4th.  estimate place last beyond another 1 2 years. Another great place food. Enjoyed setting place looked good casual enough wasn't intimidated all. staff also friendly efficient. 
We while serving brunch Saturday afternoon around 1PM splurge Beermosa. Pretty yummy first beer cocktail. else did get... Umm...
Appetizers Speck Eggs Chorizo Mac Cheese. myself definitely liked both. boyfriend also admit best deviled eggs he's hint spice add flavor. 
Entree House Pepperoni Pizza boyfriend Crispy Chicken Sandwich me. LOL. Boyfriend enjoyed pizza but he peeved told we'd having spaghetti dinner family... having Italian twice today?! XD sandwich awesome! Chicken cooked very well appreciated crunchy exterior texture plus looked good. Real good... Also enjoyed version aioli sauce last drop. Oh! also add ketchup small kick it. seriously thought taste buds outta whack until boyfriend confirm wasn't just drinking much. 
The cool part Banana Bread Pudding. Hehehe... Dessert ended meal really good note. ask your server dessert menu though 'cause verbally described you.
Not including tip everything came around $63. Worth it...!
LOL. Now know why sister brother in law keep coming without me. If you're going claim service brunch serve more just few items.   Disappointed see only handful items.   No omelette no pancakes no fruit no granola.    Curry chicken waffles great sure but you've gotta offer some basic brunch items.  may may try spot again lunch dinner.   Seemed nice place...just don't brunch. Love ambiance super cute. Doubt back prices super high hamburger $17 crazy. Maybe if service par wouldn't bothered much.  Food good but overpriced. Disappointing. waited 702 open very long time trying public school California first absolutely falling inlove it. Let start review saying really tried love place. gone least 10 times all love craft beer .

PROS Atmosphere very cool. course #1 reason anyone should rotating tap. managers tried experiences little better sending few comped meals very much appreciated but tasteless.

CONS Food nothing special. everything happy hour menu +. only thing worth eating chicken sausage which last 3 times tried give place another attempt. very small portion chicken sausage high price happy hour. only available happy hour boo thumbs down Everything else menu really really uneventful. 
Bartenders very knowledgeable beer which just plain saddening. 

Let share brunch experience. mimosas joke. If u want good bottomless mimosas suggest Echo Rig DW Bistro. mimosas 702 come premixed u which ridiculous adult choose much champagne would mimosa thank you. When asked if could OJ side answer no. When order waitress told those particular items would ready order 45 mins.. um excuse me? waited 45 mins put order another 40 food which course tasteless. Brunch complete joke waitress wasn't anything special either. 

If return beer only.  all going them. sad. expected lot more sincerely. heard place while ago thought would drop wife try both excited. 

The establishment itself nice clean. Off good start. restrooms clean also which great! greeted taken table. 

Our server polite good customer service.

The food. wife ordered steak fritz good experience. steak really rare no flavor cold. She ordered side asparagus also no flavor all. 
I ordered PB J burger. try new things decided try it. wasn't great literally ok but something wouldn't care try again.

Other food staff courteous place clean see. looking hip brunch spot Summerlin catch friend.
Menu looked pretty hip ster thought give try.
Food 3.5
They combo multiple bottomless cocktails thought cool.
The bloody mary disgusting 90% pepper 9% vodka 1% tomato juice
Thankfully friendly waitress noticed into swapped mimosa
This place huge no wait early morning brunch
Patio closed but looks cool place grab drinks evening Literally just walked out came late lunch aunt Wife baby. wife change sons diaper into women's restroom use changing station. According very incompetent girls front puddle specific stall refused unlock clean wife could use it. When wife politely requested open refused again. When wife asked another location change sons diaper told block way. eaten before food decent but service always mediocre. sealed it. Won't back sure friends families know place accommodates parents babies. Suggestion staff actually cares knows unlock stupid door wipe puddle. Ate some shrimp grits last night.  WOW.  Pretty dang good.  Service incredible.  Upon arriving told them trying catch movie Regal close next 45 minutes.  happily catered crazy schedule time spare! bummed experience especially since coworkers talk place. two hostesses looked acted bothering them when walked in. Took server 5 min come drink order even though he standing 2 feet away chatting other servers whole time. Plus restaurant wasn't very busy. Management should probably send people home when group 5 standing bar chatting whole time there. I'd probably back try some other dishes cause food good but rude employees really deter returning place. Cool menu great service wine vibe.  Easy laid back place chill lunch dinner! Really cute theme. love atmosphere very upbeat.  Beer options abundance. other hand only found two four times being liked.  Food good service excellent.  Located upstairs downtown summerlin mall very close main entrance vallet parking. truly hurts say this...the excellent food drinks did absolutely pitiful service group four received.  40 minutes before served first round plus another 40 minutes second round.  should also mention when asked waitress house red wine she replied chardonnay. should exit move.

Two additional confused servers tried give other people's food which looked amazing BTW . 

When very politely discreetly inquired receipt drinks server shall remain nameless blamed coming happy hour.  Ouch. decor ambiance restaurant excellent inviting place relax.  food selection doesn't seem many options but read through menu actually quite few.  bison burger kale brussels slaw.  quality food combined taste superb!  Pricing very reasonable over priced.  Service friendliness staff great! birthday ordered cauliflower poke starter. Both fantastic. moody burger pbj burger ordered mid rare came mid well. Luckily server  celine sprang action gave free dessert birthday shot. She great very friendly. made mistake then made right. Never bad meal definitely come back Cabbed strip couple friends.   Well worth fare.  beer selection phenomenal cuisine.  servers answered questions took care every need quickly.  4 appetizers 3 dinners all prepared order presented quickly.   best places Vegas area.  Another plus proximity Bear's Best Las Vegas.  Thanks Kyle staff. First visit come back! Excellent service Sean!  Loved calamari steak salad fish chips. friend thought fish same he'd eaten Remedys but cooked more well done a good thing . 2 jungle juices later still sober just heads don't order tingling feeling just order cuz tastes good! idea place. atmosphere great food good really good. great selection beer tap some locally brewed. well unique selection whisky spirit. 

The staff use some improvement some training hospitality. general okay.

Why two stars? because saw bar. patron ordered drink required large ice cube. cubes made hand silicone tray. removed hand literally. 

I watched bartender use unwashed fingers place cube glass then prepare drink. What's more he handled other people's dirty glassware stems. no time did see wash hands. fact he moving glassware rinse sinks dishwasher then handling tickets food plates drinks without washing between. disgusting! 

It might time call health department.

PS service slow. If could give zero stars would. Terrible terrible service. If you're sitting outside want order bar...but then no clue ordered what. manager came said want kitchen backed up. Super awesome public school! Never again. Definetly good spot woudl come back to. great deal if sign them free app. definetly did that. Also Calamari very tender tasty. portions perfect service great. Everything asked had. Even baseball game. yeah... back again. Hot Mess bomb. Hahahhaa There's always time recess!

Came friend during happy hour disappointed! 
The decor nice school theme menus look composite notebooks. nice theme without being tacky.

Drinks reasonably priced great selection brews. 
The food great but wish more options. friend shared chorizo mac n cheese margherita pizza parm truffle fries mini cheeseburgers. 

Overall food good wasn't big fan mini cheeseburgers nothing wrong just little bland would've preferred gotten something else. pizza great fries crispy well seasoned mac n cheese delicious!

Our server great she very friendly helpful helping pick some items. would come back again though! First let say service fantastic.  party 6. Emily B. server.  She kept great eye table food choices just good.   back just sit section try other choices.    Outstanding service!

We also met Jason.   Wow!!! Amazing dishes.   plan going back Sunday!   Thank much great evening!!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*** Weekend brunches great.  love location friendly whole family.  outside patio open oversized games Jenga Connect Four play.  Great drink menu food well! Great place. little loud Friday night but feels great dining social spot. Appetizers waitress very good timely. Bison burger good much Jidori chicken. friend came Friday lunch. many people restaurant. opted sit outside since nice day. service absolute worst. If plenty time spare I'd recommend place otherwise don't waste your time. great dinner other night! such cool fun atmosphere food amazing. Lots variety options everyone everything delivered well! waiter Zoe he great! Very nice gave point recommendations since first visit. He friendly attentive. Loved it! definitely back sit section! Great time. Ugh.  Food pretty good.  Ahi Poke bowl Taro chips very good.  Beer selection decent but poured wife beer glass very dark smudge she didn't see until few drinks in.  bought first round.  Fine.  Ordered Hot Mess Bison Burger both fries.  Server made sure ask if medium okay Bison agreed.  came well but still okay.  place big wait.  server nice but very busy apparently.  started weird waiting next beer order taken waiting maybe 15 20 mins just water.  Then sat longer empty plates waited way long check promised twice during wait.  sure food outweighed experience. Another welcome addition Downtown Summerlin recently opened couple weeks ago sure together pretty quick. huge restaurant very large outdoor area booths even ceiling fans well beer pong appeared. didn't outside because oven Vegas. shocked people sit outside eat 5 tables people when sitting outside. if your thing. 

We sat bar area which felt pretty spacious but filled quick. friends arrived 3 30 when first started said couple tables available. When arrived around 4 place filling quick. think left around 5 30 saw wait 6 10 people outside. If possible suggest coming early reserve spot happy hour recess. restaurant really cute details without going overboard school theme but if look close see flashcards above bar all kinds little fun cool details everywhere. am teacher don't need reminded school please but decorations cool annoying cheesy. 

We ordered Crispy Cauliflower served buffalo sauce bleu cheese  good!

Farro Brussel Sprouts Salad delicious!!

Dip Duo great bread crispy nor soft seemed old strange feeling dips just ok nothing special 

Speck Eggs enjoyed this. salty but good. 

Crispy Naked Wings am big fan wings but really good. 

Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos I enjoyed too!

Parmesan Truffle Fries say unable find place does truffle fries just want it. just right! Loved lemon aioli dipping sauce side

My hubby beers he did complain. wish some girly cocktails happy hour menu just well drinks. kind boring. 

Service good plenty workers everywhere am happy new good restaurant especially such good happy hour. food good ... service terrible say least. bartender totally distracted interested server talked way much life story...we sirancha tator tots...yummy but poor service dominated evening food affordable fresh most importantly delicious!! Love love outdoor giant games! costs definitely few dollars more normal but food drinks pretty good. Normally would probably see $5 8 beer $7 10 cocktail if you're looking prepared pay couple extra each. took seat bar told few min seat outside patio even bunch open seats. little odd but is. always good patio beautiful day but nice when isn't desert. sangria mezcal drink beer. All great options. cauliflower appetizer poke appetizer both nice little snacks bunch flavor. All all impressed options offerings mention giant Jenga connect four beer pong tables but just prepared spend extra cash if isn't happy hour. Fun atmosphere interesting spins some traditional food.

This space lot fun themed! doesn't enjoy fun back school moment? 
There's books note pads globes many fun decorations. noise level really loud wouldn't recommend coming romance good conversation. 

We ordered some liquor jungle juice mild buzz thanks bartender! love when can't taste but definitely feel it!

We decided take deviled eggs which kick them. prefer good ol traditional ones which can't seem find anywhere go. Next came margarita pizza which again kick again prefer traditional approach. comment nicely done thin crispy crust which really enjoyed. now charcuterie board...pretty damn great! Cheese crackers bread jam honey thing! can't help myself offered really nice balance mild sweet savory items enjoyed them all. 

Our waitress awesome tonight overall good time. very interested going back trying more items. 

Note very large outdoor patio area but couldn't tonight because feels hell outside. beer good. food ok. drink friend. sat bar started playing table shuffleboard again bar. Two little kids came over restaurant side wanted play. told them no kids aren't allowed bet area. came back again told them no again which point back mother said mean she started yelling. point many things wrong situation. First ITS BAR! shouldn't want your kids playing mean people bars bar period. worst part no time did manager come over anyone rectify situation. waitresses told kids ok them play bartender said no argument ensued no manager sight no offer things right. hell? If want drink relax adult somewhere else am giving place 3 stars just because some friends suggested would seem disgrace give them any less. 
Let just start saying first time expectations set really high. friends Saturday brunch. place wasn't busy all. ordered breakfast burrito which meh 2 5 . no taste but ate anyway because didn't want person. Btw ended taking half tasted way better cold . 
We also ordered bottomless drinks. WARNED drinks bottomless. mix match mimosa Bloody Mary beermosa but only 4 drinks total $15. wouldn't big deal but called before asked price bottomless drinks mentioned almost bottomless . 
It left disappointed returning. back several more times each time only gets better! food service everything! decided try brunch today awesome! Derrick server he great. knew moment he introduced himself good hands. chicken sausage grits great!! definitely back! public school few times. Every time quite impressed bar.  beer program great seems getting better.  Lots great rotating taps bottles beer lovers me.  

The food decent.  Honestly best thing hummus.  clearly perfected flat bead perfectly crisp outside fluffy inside light wood fired pizza crust.  

The service could use little fine tuning.  Whenever always feel walking into place wasn't invited where everyone aka staff all know each other don't really want add new person friend group.  When bartenders aren't distracted other staff members personal conversations always attentive friendly. Decor fun. Menu just okay nothing back for. Buffalo Cauliflower bit heavy honest much breading. Then Bison burger bland but juicy fries however crazy salty drinks disappointing. banana pudding bad but enjoyed whip cream more actual pudding. glad tried place but probably won't back any time soon. 

They also didn't guava beer date wanted ranch. restaurant doesn't ranch? Great place! Great food! Great Service! favorites appetizers. Meats cheese bacon tater tots! Steak salad truffle vinaigrette! Delicious! Great atmosphere beautiful restauant sat patio definitely request future. Inside loud full energy... style but fun some. beer great food flavorful delicious husband particularly enjoyed stuffed poblano pepper.  Friday night place packed reccind making reservation. Despite being very busy server Brad awesome very attentive. Overall great experience. Im shocked reviews Public School has. really enjoyed place. server super friendly VERY knowledgeable menu. 1 person party certain allergies she suggested few options would work her. she didn't know she found quickly brought info back right away. appetizer ahi poke tuna which came taro chips. chips good but wish few more. poke fresh sweet. Super tasty. ordered bbq bison burger ate all. sauce wasn't over powering could still taste lean meat char burger. am giving Public School A+! cool bar decent service good drinks but bit expensive.... give 3 stars since service drinks good. I'd come earlier before busy also may happy hour = downtown Summerlin looking informal inexpensive place dinner. came across Public School 702 felt would fit bill. 
Ambience huge restaurant. When walk right fairly good size bar. left biggest restaurants seen very long time. noise level quite High. If find kind buzz high energy invigorating eating indoors would right you. don't. Fortunately lovely night chose eat patio. patio also huge. very nicely laid many booths several couches.
Service server Brandon table almost immediately sat down. winning smile really Pleasant  attitude . Made feel very comfortable immediately . just two three minutes before happy hour ended. He able rush order made under wire. He also made couple recommendations. Overall very high points service.
Food started meal white bean hummus. small appetizer size portion happy hour menu just $4. Absolutely delicious just right size start meal. wife ordered happy hour sliders. 3 small hamburgers cooked perfection. She found them delicious. Margarita Pizza. just ok.
Value outstanding Ambience patio would wanted eat indoors due noise level excellent service satisfying food happy hour prices. Very good value dinner two 25 bucks Super fun atmosphere I'm teacher geeked over all teacher stuff. Food great some fun unique choices.    Nice variety draft beer.  But 5 stars because outstanding bartender server..DREW.   He friendly very knowledgeable beers wine led some fantastic drinks offering samples..and explaining each them.  great place bring people visiting. honest food bit pretentious really style. But love venue ambiance. great place grab drink friends relax weekends. even during week! Traveled all across town try place! atmosphere very cute well put together. u feel back high school.  science room all way locker rooms! 
Service good food great...a little over priced though but all all good time. place really good. If fried cauliflower crave everyday!  just wait long time table but still great experience. group happy hour last night.   food great!  drinks great. If slightly overpriced if don't something happy hour menu. service left bit desired once food came checked once. plates sat empty front use least 10 minutes check felt act congress. husband came shopping downtown Summerlin. heard lot decided try. arrived just before happy hour ended 15 min wait outside table weekday. food decent tried margarita pizza Mac cheese PB J sliders truffle fries.  pizza best but very soft crust Mac cheese good but chorizo off taste truffle fries soso sliders just weird. service sub par smaller glasses kinda feel should come back check more often. iced tea empty over half meal server also MIA quite while don't know if he tables inside toot just inattentive. Lots hype can't really see why. teacher loves recess... AKA Happy Hour PS702! dig school theme which carries throughout restaurant décor math flashcards clipped around bar menu shareable portions section called study group . They're theme restaurant without being tacky it.

FARRO BRUSSELS SPROUTS SALAD surprisingly filling could late lunch. sweet curry vinaigrette interesting lot contrasting textures.
CRISPY CAULIFLOWER breading super thin slightly spicy buffalo bleu dipping sauces served mini cast iron skillet. better versions greasy!
PARM TRUFFLE FRITES know want them. smell great but let's real everyone fancy fries days right? come spicy ketchup lemon aioli. 'em.
SPECK EGGS Another dish everyone PS touch adding crispy prosciutto kick spice.  Nicely creamy filling.
CRISPY AHI TUNA TACOS can't wrong ahi. Tiny wonton shells filled avocado ahi lightly dressed ponzu. lighter options pairs well salad above.
PB J SLIDERS dish most excited only underwhelmed by. Menu only states blackberry habanero jam smoked bacon some reason eyes interpreted word slider mini sandwich most likely heated thick challa style bread. actually 3 typical sliders mini patty bun two condiments gracelessly smeared on. less PB more J might palatable but dry beef + sticky PB = Nope.

All beer tip $40 easily feed three. Service awesome when around bar staff constantly busy point being overwhelmed. server apparently home altogether nearly half hour waiting around close tab Kourtnie kindly took care us. 

Not sure I'd come back outside recess hours but definitely fun. food approachable some innovative twists rather standard safe staples expected. first time 10 30 15 around 9pm few friends gotta say great. liked atmosphere. wasnt familiar beers offered. asked Tyler shaved head kinda built tattoos... just case theres another Tyler server he asked favorite beers. told dos equis blue moon. He said dont offer mexican beers but serve beer close blue moon called hefenweizen. thats got. did beer Tyler great choosing suggestion. he gave great service all. Thanks Tyler. enjoyed over all visit visit again. Oh yea... food great too. pepperoni pizza. Food good all some reason atmosphere restaurant really off opinion . tried twice come don't think back again. Lamb Shank served cold also bit tough side maybe cook slower? Tasty though! brought new a bit warmer also took off bill happy!  curry mashed potatoes delicious. place seems good place getting yer swerve friends kickin' happy hour amazing looking bar food appetizers. Gonna try sometime. Cheers! Great atmosphere fantastic food...Lots different appetizers grilled watermelon stack which delicious!  ordered lamb burger loved it!  just wish could cup decaf coffee! place used awesome unfortunately changed menu getting rid few great dishes increased prices. Also service lacking recently. favorite spots when first opened but don't think coming back anymore. Sorry Public School but school guy... gone three years almost every Monday menu gets changed lot but always come back. If tuna definitely recommend tuna poke !! bartenders really great feel really comfortable always positive shout Janelle took such good care during great lunch today PS 702. Interesting place interesting theme. Decent service. Saturday but DJ absolute garbage really misjudged atmosphere place. None stop techno drum bass hour? No thanks. Public School just doesn't seem place that. would back Public School again but probably Saturday. Apparently same DJ every time. used public school downtown Los Angeles many times since lived near it. decor lot better more spacious. Happy hour more variety priced very well!  wouldn't suggest bringing kids since more bar scene. Also when visit more quiet side no sitting main dining room. Just dinner here. Cool atmosphere outdoor seating very nice overlooks pretty trees water sh*t. Hostess airhead waiter actually seat booth. Waiter great though. bison burger. bad but boring. Fiancé short ribs potatoes boring. Ordered ahi tacos luckily good more good concept quality greatest. ordered ginger aoli dipping French fries delicious except really could added more ginger. Such neat place sad food mediocre. skip restaurant next time downtown summerlin area again. First time today group friends Valentine's Brunch! theme Public School darn cute! blackboard chalk writings walls composition menus binder paper napkins more! Such fun theme especially adults getting feel old school memories while drinking some beers bar. Anyway great vibes. especially love eating inside group outside patio played some beer pong life size connect 4 life size Jenga! came stayed 11am 4pm. 

Oh shoot totally forgot mention food!!! Anyway food awesome! LOVED chicken waffles!! Gotta brunch. Also great share! boyfriend stuffed French toast shared each other. order little much sweeter side prefer but still good! whole group also bottomless mimosas which carried onto outside patio more drinks come haha.   update review just wanted give shout service friends received today. Honestly always feel terrible whenever restaurants large group. understand large groups could difficult esp setting where drinks involved.. well today Emilia waitress entire time she super happy energetic just really took care keep mind group 23 people even when things getting complicated esp end when handling check everyone wanted split she never showed she bothered stressed. never experienced server while having big group before thank much Emilia rock. Don't change!  around dropping Public School tonight having familiar dtla location 612 . Casual ambiance food don't let gastropub classifier deter pretty family friendly.

Ordered Cutting Board Fiery Calamari start. calamari couldn't quite live its name flavor shichimi bit shy but otherwise passably tasty. Cutting Board fair selection cured meats cheeses as well Marcona almonds caramelized onions etc. toasts large enough share 2 others.

For myself ordered Huntsman burger which cooked liking came generous thing broccolini covered even more generous amount padano.

The service attentive even though restaurant started fill dinner crowd. No mark ups tardiness since food arrived table timely manner. Public school great spot. usually stay red rock just around corner point coming whenever can. little tricky find escalators outdoor shopping mall. But once food people atmosphere fantastic. great selection beer tap plenty food options all different types nutritional needs general good time! came birthday back November friendly me! both burger well several appetizers all very good. Great location right Red Rock Hotel where staying. Big restaurant fantastic patio. Bar busy lots energy nice looking crowd.  server Mindy Oustanding service great personality offered tastey suggestions.  Menu fun something everyone chicken want waffles GRAVY!!!! 2 stars because Food wasn't horrible but service TERRIBLE! sat near bar area wasn't many people dining meaning wasn't very busy. waitress kind clueless. She didn't know much ingredients entrees. no silverware table before being seated ask some when food first came but remind still waiting silverware second time she came drop off other meals. ordered Drink could see Bartender making it..... Then just sat 10 mins...... see all other staff just standing near bar taking shots Beer???!!!?? waitress finally bought over. Management needs team train young staff more professional. Probably don't plan ever returning joint. bad architecture place really fits name which cool hang out. Very cool spot great dinner late night drinks snacks. shortly 9pm Saturday night busy! sat booth near bar outlets USB outlets wall every restaurant should this! .

Ordered crispy buffalo cauliflower which possibly best vegetable ever eaten bacon cheddar tots. attempt healthy tomato watermelon stacked salad. just okay. hubby steak which came chorizo mac cheese. mac cheese fantastic! cheesy greasy still very flavorful. 

I often feel 70 year trapped nearly 40 year old body little noisy taste but if 6 30 Wednesday night instead sure would've slightly different experience. But overall great food I'd definitely back! Met some friends brunch sunny Saturday morning. Since such nice day decided dine outside. outside few games which include giant size Connect Four Jenga. theme restaurant cute. regular menu designed look those composite notebooks brunch menu scantron brings back memories doesn't it? . all ordered bottomless mimosas...which turned meant maximum 5 or maybe 6? medium carafes. guess good put cap much but should really called bottomless then? mean don't wrong still plenty good buzz all drank but still. However plus beermosa michelada bloody mary switch if like. Anyways food!

Crispy buffalo cauliflower lightly fried cauliflower came side buffalo ranch sauce. liked would recommend. cauliflower wasn't mushy all. 

Chorizo mac cheese probably favorite. lot flavor enjoy pasta used. 

Fried chicken green chili cornbread waffles just alright. wasn't fan texture cornbread waffle green chili sauce forgettable. 

Fire roasted vegetable hash eggs least favorite. didn't much flavor bland me. felt literally put whole black beans  just much me. 

Eggs Benedict pizza pretty tasty. Prosciutto gave nice salty flavor crust nice char it. tell cooked brick oven. 

Stuffed French toast good! filled different berries. thought would really sweet way looked but wasn't! nice sweet flavor without being overwhelming. 

Our waitress great! She knowledgeable menu answered any questions had. She also did great job keeping drinks full. 

Overall feel food just okay. huge hurry come back anytime soon but glad gave try. Menu looks good back food. Pretty nice beer selection definitely enjoyed several. Server Michael did great job describing recommending based taste preferences easy we're pretty eclectic group. Happiness all around. First time tonight Happy Hour two other couples.  waitress Jordann super nice very attentive.  Gave all sample beers no hesitation.  Happy Hour menu good.  buffalo cauliflower fantastic.  margarita pizza eh just okay.  beer selection GREAT.  Ended Brainless Belgian high octane smooth finish really good.  Love finding new beers when out.  place dead.  Tuesday might day?  But really surprised no happy hour.  Huge place.  Big balcony nicely done.  Prices great happy hour.  would come back dinner give another rating but happy hour job well done.  Would great place private event. Note review drinks only. The mac 'n' cheese looked crazy good! sat bar during happy hour. some decent food deals. Some drinks specials but never course best beer offerings. paid $11 pint! While good unique beer $11 much. took over 10 mins approached bartender though credit she seemed really busy . nearly much time check. cool. But again bar under staffed. space itself nice. beer offerings good. plenty TVs watch game. There's nice outdoor area. food looked tasty. But staff are...underwhelming unattentive. No greeted upon entry exit. can't say ever happen before. But sour apricot beer excellent. Though sure $11 excellent. Worst.
Service.
Imageable.
On two different occasions tried give them redo more same.  Just overall lack service. wanting try restaurant happy when invited Sunday brunch group friends.

She new regular! found food buffalo cauliflower edamame hummus Brussels sprouts salty oily. buffalo cauliflower other restaurants where fried but still light case here. dish also overly salty. edamame hummus also terribly salty but no other flavors if tahini completely overpowered salt. flatbread came okay but za'atar strong. Brussels sprouts okay but again overpowered oil. kind side dish comes dozen Brussels sprouts but three your palate done. also surprised two dishes could vegan friendly actually aren't because cheese already incorporated. example quinoa salad sounded great but feta already mixed quinoa getting salad without feta can't done. number times since opened time best. If wasn't bad service food varying great barely edible other trip would given 5 stars. time food perfect beer list strong nothing tried order gone waitress Rachel perfect.

Great gastro food. great service! few times. Large dining selection beers. menu changes occasion. scallop salad which no longer have. Recently lamb burger excellent. chicken salad which pretty good but chicken didn't seem anything special sure if even made chicken house. All together tasty great spot Vegas Summerlin! decided mission try all restaurants Downtown Summerlin next list Public School 702!

This restaurant very cute charming schoolhouse theme throughout. appeared training new employees when visited lunch both hostess servers shadowing other employees. Everyone cheerful pleasant aside newbies asking few questions more experienced didn't detract service all.

We settled appetizer cheese bacon tator tots. yummy! Deep fried tator tots bacon cheese inside served sirracha ketchup wrong? 

For main course CCB which version Cobb sandwich. chicken patty served lettuce avocado bacon onion own special sauce. yummy! loved bread although didn't hold well end. fries good great thin fries but again sirracha ketchup helped add little kick.

My friend enjoyed burger well but didn't taste it. vast selection beers if into brews looked really fun outdoor area.

Another Downtown Summerlin restaurant checked off list! wouldn't mind getting detention though! 1st visit great girl bartenders cool. 2nd visit sat bar just looked male day bartender without greet acknowledgement. just left. Won't going back anymore. place bookmarked excited try sweetheart. right top happy hour sat bar. Wednesday easily able choose seats. time left glad came early because bar restaurant really filling up. Ladies there's hooks hang your purses bar. swear bars always points this! 

I Mule kick cocktail...tasty but heavy ginger. food ordered only happy hour menu which call Recess. 
The deviled eggs sharp taste yummy.  those again. usually tastes fried food but fried cauliflower awesome. light tasty I'd again well. also hummus quinoa flavor light side healthier feel. I'd again. 

My favorite which came complete surprise because biggest fan peanut butter PB j sidekicks. mini burgers touch peanut butter delightful having rethink peanut butter again Absolutely mind blowing Amazing. Super fresh everything made house service A1. Beer crafty well priced happy hour hit. recommend everyone try place out.   wings fried cauliflower on house meatball linguini also Thai noodle salad. Everything beyond expecting.  Thanks PS702 ill back Located new shopping district Summerlin...Public School 702 home Downtown Summerlin. very modern hip restaurant themed school education atmosphere. Everything menus decorations sets place off right. huge place located second floor also outdoor balcony area almost rivals inside seating course depending weather. casual yet restaurant provides quick friendly service staff also dressed casual. quite sure came weekend noticed weekend menu...so might separate weekday well. also happy hour which call recess which plays theme. Menu choices kinda small but quality choices there. bar grill brewery type restaurant expect usual burgers custom beers alcohol. Choices even Lamb Bison burgers which tender juicy mouthwatering delicious. Still Public School 702 family kid friendly very refreshing. casual still gives classy feeling fun elegance. Prices average maybe slightly little more casual dining...but service ambience well food. Definitely recommend place least try once twice if area long day shopping Downtown Summerlin. Cool little spot Downtown Summerlin. Friday around 7 00 play game beer pong outside. outside sitting area really chill ton people having happy hour drinks. took 10 minutes drink waiting bar. Bartenders just didn't seem any sense urgency. Beer pong fun but drink house pilsner which worst. no option change upgrade downgrade your beer. Because only played game high tailed Red Rock some gambling. just came some drinks those most point pretty point.  bar restaurant very well designed modern bartender personable seemed know stuff waitresses pretty.  more could want?  wanted try food though definitely back some point that.  just wish wasn't far away me! happy hour server Victoria amazing! usually used servers kind coasting during happy hour which understandable considering busy be. But she awesome. Great recommendations attention detail. Thanks Victoria! came brunch other day great! service quick food tasted great thank Vanessa! favorite eggs Benedict pizza. atmosphere bright clean public school theme fun. even planned come back brunch next week! ordered wild mushroom pizza ahi tuna tacos cutting board which charcuterie. Loved pizza but crispy me. tacos amazing. cutting board nothing special. Because being new service just okay. They're still learning. outside terrace amazing hang drink. First time today very well! around 230 wasn't busy seated quickly. Unfortunately early RECESS love that happy hour.

Interior very cute motif loved menu! 

Waiter didn't catch name but he ponytail glasses haha but he awesome! 
One thing though although LOVE ketchup sriracha dip came food he should asked if wanted regular ketchup ketchup siracha know just case ppl wouldn't combination but mean... siracha! Jk... Maybe  why he didn't ask..who'd reject such thing!? When told he should hook more sauce he did suggested bbq mustard sauce would food but thought tasted better brother's pizza but appreciated incentive.

Food Colorado Lamb Burger medium rare omg. melted mouth. thought delicious! Loved savory lamb sweetness jam together. 

My brother pizza which thought okay. 

A friend tortilla soup sliders didn't try sliders but looked dry she said ok. taste tortilla soup flavor light where tortilla soup blasting flavors mean wasn't bad but just used to? 

Pro dishes kale quino cauliflower other things if you're feeling something more healthier? 'preciate . 
+ children's menu

Con kind wish more selections nonalcoholic drinks though but understand more pub kind thing but craving strawberry lemonade other fruity carbonated drinks. mean since serve burgers maybe shakes? Haha. become new favorite places. menu overwhelming but choices nice change norm. Recess aka Happy Hour great!  decent amount drinks appetizers really good prices. large  patio looks over Downtown Summerlin  staff always friendly! would zero stars but  option. came dinner some friends. Literally...the worst service food ever. waitress kept forgetting drinks food cold cooked well keep sending things back. troubles...we received free dessert just okay. definitely won't coming back while. Chef Jeremy killed it! 10 10 fish chips. Definitely would recommend Public School! Try Cauliflower Buffalo appetizer Andrew girl Ryan amazing ! Fun friendly bartenders GREAT FOOD! many beers pick from!  love school atmosphere. prices great!! new favorite spots ! ***edited***
Two years later wouldn't back EVER AGAIN.
Everything ordered wrong most recent trip. Service AWFUL. own silverware napkins asked several times them finally gave them myself . food finally came second time brought half meal still raw. ask speak manager THREE times. third time started timer see long would take. almost 10 minutes before friend just found her. never back***


2015 Seriously impressed. came Fathers Day last minute decision very glad did.
The service rocky first but quickly turned corner very pleased.
We ordered pancetta deviled eggs Bloody Mary draft beer start. Everything great. Mary's SPICY if isn't your thing forewarned believe spicier better. comes topped chicken wing would preferred bacon olives something else .
My husband ordered adobo tacos rice ordered CCB brown bag fries sriracha ketchup. first burger came slightly raw. When let server know she wonderful manager came over let know sorry he was. sent new better expected. sriracha ketchup just right amount kick really liked it.
Even though stuffed saw Lemon Meringue pass couldn't help but order. glad did. probably best lemon meringues ever had.

All all highly recommend place definitely check Recess soon friends. Came friends birthday. Friendly service food mediocre. Nothing really great spot. ordered margarita pizza Hummus dip tuna tartar taro chips those all descent. chicken soba Thai salad no flavor all mess salad. Chicken Cesar salad just ok husbands lamb burger plain. may give another try during happy hour because located DT summerlin very eclectic environment. If want reminisce regarding your middle school high school environment while dine delicious food place Each dish varies price quantity. But tried nearly everything menu chefs phenomenal job. beer wine selection pretty extensive prepared Peruse. 
They indoor outdoor seating. indoor seating very lively. outdoor seating provides wonderful vista shopping plaza perfect getaway date night dinner group friends. some outdoor games chess checkers oversize Jenga. Overall wonderful place eat staff always professional provides top quality service... well some details your childhood civics class still may know answer to. amazing theme restaurant. Highly recommend happy hour really good good amazing atmosphere. regular menu prices little high but good selection. Only issues amount salt fries came burger. thought only but apparently same issue those ordered fries party well. it! service pretty good. build space awesome. Ambiance little loud but lively. If beer selection pretty good too. Bathrooms clean overall good experience. 

My only reservation although food good could've better. think recipes lacked flavor even though cooked well. Desert just OK could tell store bought cake ice cream. deviled eggs bison burger. Kale salad good!

I'd definitely again try more menu. place just opened few months ago love here!  really good food especially bar food night life awesome too.  totally would check place dinner drinks just late night drinks! Brussel sprouts farro salad scallops point. lemon meringue outstanding probably dreams it.  loved Crushed Velvet cocktail.  Overall bomb outdoor patio. Fantastic service.  Cool vibe. definitely returning. Expensive. Food decent kinda loud inside. gimmicky decor super cute. Super fun place bomb hamburger tons beer tap. clueless but very sweet waiter. Check spot! service theme food drinks culture must visit. 

We arrived told going 30 min but sat 15. hostess friendly even though she talking someone she able still look smile let know she would minute. Simple acknowledgement very long way!

The menus black notebooks which immediately caught eye beer list typed notebook paper. Very original.

Started vanilla blueberry canned beer called big blue van surprisingly really good! specialize lot crafted beers if beer recommend spot. Next tuna nicoise salad then short ribs. food prompt very good. 

Service 5 stars. Even though server many others touched table sure ok check if needed anything. back sure!

Side note cool spot group gatherings oudoor patio area its own bar AND.... beer pong table!!! Lol lunch today service absolutely horrendous.  slow taking order slow bringing food slow bringing check.  3rd time service slow but worst part servers kept propping door open cold outside breeze.  customer across asked them close door.  closed minute until propped open again another server.  4th time door propped open asked manager.  15 minutes later he never came.  While addressing issue another customer walked server table asked door closed.  explained experience she asked server point manager she walked into kitchen area speak he asked same servers shut door.  server wrote receipt next time come manager wasn't would give free appetizer.  other words manager duty didn't care customers all didn't offer anything take time come over address issue all customers area complaining cold was.  least people outside heaters.  Needless say never going again. review bartender Amanda knowledgable prompt super pleasant during high traffic shift. Thanks!

On side note kitchen slight foul. Foil mixed burger eep! Pulled didn't fuss because Colorado Lamb Burger ridiculously good. Keep eye your stuff fellas! No worries we'll keep coming back. Great place! Love decor food. executed school theme well composition book menus homework togo boxes. Very clever! bison burger delicious ! meat tender cooked perfection! side fries excellent well really enjoyed siracha ketchup. also recommend house pepperoni pizza. thin crunchy crust topped fresh jalapeños incredible pepperoni. great place come friends especially during recess AKA happy hour. Definitely returning public school 702! Food okay. such high expectations since husband raved it. come back try more things.  favorite thing chorizo Mac cheese minus chorizo.  Chorizo pieces hard liking but hubs said  supposed real chorizo.  Loved topped salt vinegar potato chips. way yummy. kept going back more! short ribs which very tender just enough flavor me. needed salt. Nutella cookie good but prefer soft gooey cookies little hard. husband said could ask them warm up. 

Next visit want try shrimp pasta bison burger lemon dessert I did also find strange reservations over 6 need manager approval. never callback confirm. Luckily plans changed just party four able reserve line.  Service good once there. Waitress nice helpful apologetic when dessert took some time. Overall cool new spot just find some favorite dishes. crowded.  very good service servers foods okay.  Love atmosphere though. While poking around Downtown Summerlin search late ish dinner husband stumbled upon Public School. patio looked fun love kind look feel going upstairs went. 

We seated immediately which wasn't surprising nearly 9pm dining area patio both pretty expansive. server friendly let know opening day. 

We tempted several appetizer choices myself buffalo cauliflower husband bacon tots but exercised self control...mostly because picture Nutella cookie popped slide show bar husband's eyes glazed over.

He decided shrimp grits farro brussels salad subbing roasted chicken scallops. took quite while food but understood opening day still service kitchen bugs smoothed out. Nearly 40 minutes ordered food arrived. 

He very happy portion shrimp although slightly overlooked. grits...which prepared seared polenta tasty he liked greens grilled corn. 

My salad excellent chicken really flavorful M word hate rhymes hoist joist. love texture farro excellent combined shaved brussel sprouts butternut squash pecans dried cranberries. extremely filling. 

We shared nutella cookie sandwich which two huge chocolate chip cookies served warm slathered Nutella vanilla ice cream sandwiched between. shared mean he let couple bites without cracking knuckles spoon. 

I deducted star because even opening day 40ish minutes excessive time wait meal without any interaction server. both agreed wanted try brunch menu saw other things dinner menu wanted try. long service issues ironed see place being very successful great addition Downtown Summerlin. such easy go to restaurant when want fancier meal. If you're terrible bring your charger ask sit booth bar section. outlets. favorite app crispy buffalo cauliflower which just can't quite imitate home though try . eggs benedict pizza good brunch choice but chicken sandwich the brunch one friggin good normal burger *elevated* love bangers mash. always try drink but normally don't alcoholic drinks much good guide there. seasonal! 

The servers nice. did Nevada trivia first time boyfriend. Before though tinder date he ordered second glass wine but super uncomfortable poured most down drain patio when he bathroom. waitress saw explained he creep then when he didn't pay wine HE ordered waitress took second glass off bill drew smiley face it. yeah. Good place. husband just restaurant lunch. absolutely phenomenal. some delicious beer some amazing food. red quinoa salad amazing need little more seasoned aggressively. meatballs which also little spicy but very good Buffalo cauliflower however wish would grilled instead fried really tasty little blue cheese dressing buffalo sauce. breading heavy just don't fried food much. would recommend restaurant sure friends anyone else looking good variety foods. large beer menu. Some menu changes every week while major beers always available. 4 time now sit outside every time. Describing outside seating area humungous understatement. just keeps going going... 
Since public school 702 second level u very nice view downtown summerlin. also located prettiest spot next big water sculpture cactus gardens. 
The view cool but jumbo sized games best reason sit outside. huge version connect 4 Jenga along beer pong. 
On last visit tried pbj burger sliders which fairly good. meat little drier liked but bacon good peanut butter jelly burger better sounds.
Our waitress fantastic. Best food drink Summerlin! Great place sit meet new people. Bartender Scott Manager Tommy very friendly provide great service. Highly recommended all! Chef Jeremy fantastic!

My entree Fried JIdori Chickem Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. while since Fried Chicken Waffles. last time down south Atlanta GA. pretty darn good. Public School 702 took Fried Chicken Waffles another level. fried chicken your normal wing thigh pieces. enjoy mixed then traditional. incorporated chicken tender meat breast. Still wing drumstick. things stood once dish. hot sauce top chicken but completely soaked it. batter use fan BIG TIME. love crispy crust. ton flavor meat inside all pieces cooked perfection. waffles adding green chili just plain waffles. Yay! f could would order each separate just double amount. When put both together then throw some bacon sauce whatever side dish. Unreal delicious. Memorable. Hearty. No doubt heart attack. Once while want indulge heavy good your health dish. way go. 

I wanted try sirachi ketchup mustard sauce brown bag fries. fries just fries. sauces devine. honey mustard sauce could use spread ANY sandwich. sirachi stable condiments fan of. tasty. If want take fries another level sure use both sauces.

The staff awesome. server she amaZing. nine she top it. Explained everything first timers myself. Made great suggestions menu. Friendly. know lot times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. She said problem all. Think two three appetizers lucked free. Thank Public School 702. attending class again sooner then later............Good stuff!!!! Decor Very hip modern schoolhouse theme mind. Scoreboards globes straight geography class adorn ceiling. There's even ceiling made basketball volleyball court hanging above bar. place looks great happy hour especially NBA Finals going on. However...

Food Service wish opportunity try some food. Hell wish opportunity even order food. girlfriend sat down bar area tables during happy hour. literally waited 15 minutes I timed it single waiter waitress stopped asked if wanted water drinks food etc. 

We walked insult injury added hostess telling good day seemingly unaware literally sat table staring each other 15 minutes.

Public School first time recently really great experience. public school theme really cool. menu great. lil something everybody. food ordered wonderful. server extremely attentive. food came super quickly. ordered guavalajara cocktail best cocktails ever had. only criticism whole experience bar took FOREVER drinks us. However server ended comping glass wine wait can't annoyed. definitely going back recommending friends. isn't favorite place Downtown Summerlin eat regular but home pretty amazing happy hour. also atmosphere which best Vegas groups.

Service extremely slow plus food isn't good. Way pricy offer. reading reviews hoping just caught them bad day. seated right away server came shortly. didn't really understand explanation menu rotation choices worked but she did seem friendly. 
Our food cam cold service very slow. Took 15 minutes drinks. 5pm busy. 
There many food options Downtown Summerlin would probably choose patron somewhere else next time. Public school Downtown Summerlin good place  drinks hang friends. also great place brunch weekend. menu different options compared your traditional weekend hot spot.

Buffalo cauliflower 

The cutting board meats cheeses grapes 

Bangers n Mash chicken herb sausages Brussel bacon mash

Bacon Cheddar Tots good even though app small. calamari also good aioli more generous portion. Wild Mushroom Taleggia pizza delish. usually Shorty Bowl sooo fkn good! but today trying BBQ Bison Burger Fish Chips bae.

Oh games giant Jenga beer pong Connect 4!  always plus would any dinner date less boring.

Service little slow
Sat balcony great views downtown summerlin
Not happy no longer lemon meringue pie! lunch. lunch menu really scaled down which understandable. 
Had Mac cheese which better recipes tried town. fry sauces kind delicious. Also tried specialty lavender cocktails which delightful senses. companion enjoyed hot dog complimented beer selection. 
We sat quite some time before drink order taken seemed brief staff meeting trying check cashed lack star rating pertains speed service. Luckily weren't time crunch but if would back quick lunch. Public School 702 day Christmas. few friends late dinner suggested try Chorizo Mac Cheese Shrimp Grits. both phenomenal. shrimp grits most amazing dishes ever had. Perfectly cooked shrimp amazing plating...kudos chef. back more! Chris Chan Ok dying try place finally took 16 18 year old kids family day outing which Sundays . impressed menu....very cool decor atmosphere. beer warm food cold. Just awful. son didn't even eat food luckily daughter didn't see anything menu sound good she asked just try food. edible. Dry but edible. ended eating Italian place afterwards great there! bummed didn't enjoy place. Even server pretty blah. But oh well! Service very inattentive late might food offerings minimal although excellent live music far loud. Hummus fantastic Burger OK. Pizza technique OK just really under seasoned. little more time maybe certainly potential. place very cool. love school theme down Menu having cover composition notebook napkins looking lined paper drinks clipboard. bar area resembled cafeteria style seating too. lighting soft but brighter most which made great pics at least bar seating . definitely packed. menu wasn't very extensive but unique items. Prices reasonable. could order appetizers under $10. Speaking appetizers ordered chicken wings edamame hummus buffalo cauliflower bacon cheddar tater tots. 

The cauliflower GOOD!! didn't know expect honestly. thought would steamed cauliflower. But breaded fried. Considering veggie very soft actually very crunchy flavorful! couldn't tell cauliflower there. gave enough share. favorite thing there. 

The chicken wings ok didn't any but family did. family also LOVED Bacon Cheddar tots. expected them smothered but weren't. literally tater tots bacon cheese inside. good! personally also loved Edamame Hummus. family liked but much tots cauliflower. But hummus 2nd fave. flatbread grilled seemed open fire because pieces charred which added flavor. love charred pieces! very surprised hummus bread would order again sure! 

My brother pizza which impressed with. wouldn't order but glad tried slice. Something crust.....

But guys....I tried PB J Burger.....split quarters. Crunchy peanut butter blackberry habanero jam house made . real piece meat! scared! love some burgers very skeptical....and sharing helped ease fears LOL! BUT actually very good!!! feel jam could spicier wish were but maybe would spicy some also never tell hot pepper until taste it. Also jam very runny almost syrup. But overall would order again SHARE. 

Service ok. pizza came all finished eating must've forgotten? served appetizers but didn't give any plates silverware ask those.  why deducted 1 star. 

Overall would recommend place plan back! Heard place decided try out. 8 PM tonight.  wait few minutes table.  lady helped very nice.  Sadly she last staff member spoke us.  Sat table waiting someone stop maybe take drink order but never wait staff  member stop by.  several wait staff walk but never said word made eye contact us.  waited tables both sides us.  can't recommend place.  When asked let everyone know bad experience was.  Don't waste your time dinner another place close great. Really cool concept whole restaurant. decor white boards menu made feel your back elementary school. just wished service food better!

FOOD
Nothing really special here. tried number appetizers the bacon cheddar tots buffalo cauliflower calamari along couple drinks but all pretty basic. appetizers drinks around $10 each. Nothing would rave come back for. drinks good did fact variety beers tap but other would come back solely food.

SERVICE
This main reason why am only giving them 2 star rating. waiter didn't really seem he knew he doing. He would take orders then come back ask again because he didn't write them down. When he brought water bottle he also didn't pour any initially when he saw glass empty ones ask another bottle water instead anticipating needs. other waiter delivering food passed because she unsure where food go. felt system clunky.

LOGISTICS
There's never really any issue parking when here. also wasn't wait good. USB regular outlets where plug your phone cool.

This place isn't bad. looks nice modern but service poor. managers need retrain staff if anything. wouldn't recommend others here. Try another place better food better service! Fun atmosphere especially when music patio... great new place city. experience place loud food overpriced. bad food just worth it. Service pretty good. winner! Summerlin residents tried every new restaurant Downtown Summerlin several times. Right gate very good. Beer selection amazing best beer life Thai chili best apps amazing chicken waffle entrée. Excellent layout tons outdoor seating East side building smart play. Laid back environment but very weak bar drinks ordered 4 fireball shots but looked 1 shot split 4 ways then all 4 drinks ordered tasted non alcoholic.  long island ice tea more arnorld palmer.....leaving now next bar Came GNO appetizers drinks food amazing!
The school house theme interesting. 
Ordered Calamari Cheddar Cauliflower wow best places Calamari. Super crunchy sauce comes just enough spice. 
The only let down there's no flavor mix margarita! usually drink mango margarita only able regular margarita. delish enough but enough liquor. Still good. 

The price however pretty pricy. Just 1 appetizer drink almost $20. 
Still would come back again just hang pre game wife here. When walked really loud thinking going suck. staff great when food Holy Crap!!! Awesome. PS Burger probably best burger ever had. alot beers didn't try any time but back many other times try all different beers. Definitely try place won't sorry. Food great!! service much. 
Entertainment great enjoyable.. 
I recommend place just food but please patient servers because very slow .. took forever drinks forever order new drink when did finally chance order drink 10 15 minutes back bar ! decided check place heard few good things food great beer selection.  Upon arrival greeted hostess quickly seated.  beer selection very extensive including limited rotating selection beers disappears pretty quickly.  lucky enough try Deschutes Abyss Imperial Stout flagship beers very limited.  also brunch happy hour great selection beers happy hour pricing $4 pint.  include likes Left hand milk stout Duvel First Amendment.  decided try hangar steak salad excellent.  great server Katie.  She took care brought dessert try missing applewood smoked bacon salad.  tried ice cream sand which two chocolate chip cookies Nutella vanilla ice cream. Delicious!!!!  also banana creme pie jar. absolutely amazing just recently added menu.  Thanks Katie!!! Spot on!!!  back just desserts maybe even beer two. new favorite place. love atmosphere creative decor schoolhouse theme. outside patio fantastic spring. very roomy gorgeous view. fun drinks good prices buffalo cauliflower appetizer fantastic. tortilla soup salads both which very very good. great server super fun time enjoying bottomless drink brunch. really excited back eat drink again very soon. quite excited eat menu looked right alley Gastropub.  dining area very loud if want able hear each other sit outside.  outside area very nice great view. There's misters fans.  music needs help but just blocked good convo. 
The service good didn't utensils but came asked. guy seemed new serving which fine right order drinks filled.  
The food pretty good slammin but delicious. tater tots chorizo mac cheese start.  tater tots very greasy hardly any crunch lacked bacon flavor supposed have. missed mark but idea good if could execute would great. tots just fell apart mushy. 
The Mac cheese sausage chorizo big kettle chips top.  cheesy but love crunchy bread crumb topping mac cheese didn't chips just fell off useless. wished also used ground chorizo stuff excellent when mixed gooey cheese.  
For main courses Shrimp cheddar grits really good.  Great sauce light grit patty nice crunch it.  did right awesome. 
We also short ribs.  bit fatty but meat very tender great flavor. reminded meal you'd home holiday.  mashed potatoes sitting nice gravy give plenty meat.  also put some crispy brussell sprout chips top.  really good.  Nice salty slight char. 
All all pretty good some kinks work but great place eat outside drinks food. If play some good music it'll hip hang out. I'd back sure. Just happy hour Public School.  nice easy food selections decent good.  Drinks reasonable service excellent.

Don't know if establishment location.  very busy area seems craving family type businesses.  Also lot locals area seem crave just really simple food choices may little different some.  Just opinion.... Came big group friends left Pkwy tavern since charging fee if didn't reservations due rousey fight.  

Service great.  waiter very attentive since 14 us.  drink really good recommend pear necessities. food however wasn't really par charging.  pizza greasy pretty bland even ordering 3 different types pizzas. French fries good hot wing cauliflower okay. 

The decor theme interesting. Totally forgot solar systems used class. Overall place very hipster but made good back plan but closed early being Friday night.  ended hopping over dave busters. Public School list place try since opening Downtown Summerlin. When given chance dine Wednesday jumped chance dinner cool spot perched second floor Dining Arroyo favorite shopping center Vegas. Although Public School did provide unique modern dining lounge option great views service menu fell
short expectations.

Upon arriving seated immediately comfortable booth. decor modern hip excited experience. server took while greet I saw another server arguing taking table but when he arrived friendly. ordered couple beers Hummus appetizer.  Hummus excellent fried chick peas top
And served excellent grilled flatbread.  For
Dinner ordered Thai noodle salad he ordered shrimp grits. Although looking cold noodle salad fell short. lot dressing ingredients just ok. fair shrimp grits supposedly excellent.  beer also ok mine being little hoppy matching favorite ciders he usually orders.

My gripe place seems want pretentious elevated menu but staff seems unmotivated convey ideas to
The guest. would loved better recommendation beverage maybe some ideas special unique menu options. Instead asked if ready order if wanted dessert which cool unless your intentions provide more chef driven casual menu.

P.S. nothing worse opening menu arriving your table being stuck together food whatever else. particular annoyance supposed upscale casual restaurant prices match.. just saying.. wife thought food okay but ended food poisoning. She sick all night now am home work taking care boy. would expect something better restaurant downtown Summerlin. your own risk. kept procrastinating checking place out....and finally early dinner here.

Here's deal...the food good beer selection good menu selection ok would rank 3 1 2 4 stars own. layout theme place rate 4 stars well...but when take good restaurant excellent waitstaff kicks notch.

Our server Victoria certainly highlight evening. Wife totally appreciated suggestions great attitude attentiveness.

We few appetizers deviled eggs crispy prosciutto ..a little underseasoned but very tasty. hey chef...salt pepper your friends kitchen Meatballs Al Forno...these perfect some best ever little heat sauce grilled levain...which ostentatious way saying tiny pieces grilled sourdough bread. Chef...more sauce couple more pieces bread...uhhh...levain.

For DInner wife Pan Seared Salmon which she loved Skirt Steak Tacos side Bacon Cheddar Tots. Tacos little dry side but tasty tots amazing sriracha ketchup. 

All all menu little room improvement. guys fun we'll coming back school more lessons. love place! Really great drinks their lavender Moscow mule favorite food good haven't anything didn't like. Industry night Monday everything half off which great. boyfriend wanting come Public School 702 some time. Saw great things website creative concept great craft cocktails amazing beer list. would deserve 5 itself. Although unfortunately service could used 1 star. bartender made drinks gave bill sat down dinner. once asked drinks if wanted another. took drinks down left some cash bar walked out. Didn't hear single goodbye thank come three staff members huddled around each other. Kyle D biggest Dick first all. Second ask glasses ice water separate 3 filthy water bottles brought table supporting PS midst all other better food beer joints. awesome meal last night!  crispy buffalo cauliflower totally craveable farro Brussels sprout scallop salad delicious!  scallops perfectly cooked combination flavors textures awesome!  Wish could vegetables delicious!  Cocktails fantastic decor lovely creative. definitely return soon! Great drinks good service but little pricey get. atmosphere top notch. Its definitely worth try if you're looking new place eat drink downtown summerlin. Came opening day again week later. Everything delicious. Food came quick servers very friendly! Cocktails beer exceptional. Loved atmosphere interior design. Many people complaining slow service sure why. Public School band new restaurant still settling its expected hick there. definitely back!

Spacious laid back atmosphere patio beautiful! Staff friendly always smiling. ordered all apps Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower  best ever had! Parmesan Truffle Frites Ahi Tuna Poke! Topped off Just Bottomless cocktails! vote! 3 1 2 stars

Great atmosphere. Very fun great attention detail. just feel over paid semi good food. bad don't want over state it. priced line most similar restaurants. just tend end types places. group friends enjoyed amazing brunch New Year's Day . server Katie excellent very attentive. highly recommend try Jidori Chicken Waffles delicious  . Public School 702 5 star book Love place cool atmosphere great food. don't think there's anything menu  good. also good beer list drinks. only bad thing little pricey. Food delicious locally sourced beer selection pretty decent too! friend diet asked just chicken shredded romaine lettuce no dressing... no anything but charged $16 which seemed ridiculously steep. If pricing more appropriate would given place 5 stars. Great happy hour very good food. truffle fries only during happy hour worth trip just those.  Nice beer selection well. love sitting patio which very comfortable booth seating plus some couches. little crowded noisy inside. service always very good too. party last night Julian server. Great guy he definitely took care us. sure seated where Julian is. concept restaurants Downtown Summerlin good intentions. Unfortunately every other restaurant tried DTS Public School bust. friends arrived 9pm Thursday. walk two people talking doorway. Oh wait they're just two people hanging lounging doorway horrible posture work apparently despite nonchalance toward any potential customers. 

We seated HUGE booth 3 unbussed crumbs sticky crap all over. Lovely. When asking directions restrooms same rude service. table cleaned find bathroom eventually order some very mediocre food. Fried cauliflower amazing everyone describes. exactly sounds like. just fried cauliflower $9 something. think mark 999981625536% head cauliflower $.89 store.

We ordered chicken waffles everyone raved shown menu. given tandoori brick chicken instead? guess waitress didn't hear but mystery gets thicker... apparently chicken waffles no longer menu despite saw infront eyes! host lounging door handing old menus server assumed said thing didn't ask again clarify. when she brings wrong item she said okay? want keep it? Ha!!! If someone ordered chicken waffles think tandoori brick chicken middle eastern spices fill craving? No. course don't want brick chief want chicken waffles which despite being off menu made us? 

So finally chicken waffles. Waffles good hitting every taste buds sweet savory luscious crispy. chicken disgusting. fried chicken tenders but tenders HUGE cut poorly. Think 3 inch chicken tender... only good thing ate kale Caesar salad which would order again if someone dragged public school 702. If wasn't bound dragged would never find again. 

My review confusing but experience. Everything night contradicted another. Hosts servers chefs no idea going working team. restaurant open long enough fix issues no excuses disappointing night. Yesterday husband took place. absolutely loved concept restaurant. place reminded much something would probably see back NY! menu short simple. drinks good. chorizo Mac n cheese appetizer delicious! mash bangers meal. Now meal supposed come chicken instead came chorizo but still good anyways. fruity drink forget name something jungle lol. really good but beware really strong. alcohol creep you. husband flat iron steak he loved it. also dessert. husband did enjoy brownie all. way rich dark chocolate him. Nutella cookie pretty good. prices portions good staff very nice. would def come back try rest stuff menu! Good atmosphere.  games terrace beer pong jenga Good service also. Wish more Whiskey selection. 
Food good but excellent. 
THEY DONT RANCH DRESSING WTF!!
how am going eat chicken fingers?? Pretty good happy hour delicious food! Just many drink options happy hour menu. Lovely location very low key! Friendly people's employee's. Yelp labeled them pool house. no pool tables But beer pong tables shuffle boards jenga. Cool chill environment lot choices far eats dinner.... settle fish chips didn't come craft beer but food huge disappointment. Service fine but send food back cooked way originally requested. time back rest table finished. Okay food best. great bike shop just hit awesome status those Summerlin. Same great staff perfect location... Trust them give great service will... Terrible. Just checked place first time may never back. waiter very very nice but waited 10 minutes before asked if needed menu. 5 different servers came table realized management wasn't order. fiancé ordered mojito which took 21 minutes arrive. also three beers tried order.

Great idea place but definitely need figure run team servers. Maybe MAYBE try couple months work kinks. First timer. view patio nice. 

Nothing special waiter. food wasn't hot. ran chicken Bloody Mary. ran mixers Bloody Mary. mentioned manager when she stopped table she unaware concerned. allow vaping patio stinks. rec'd cloud smoke blowing way.

Won't going back. area today decided try place thought would good experience brunch Sunday. turned opposite loud kids playing tabletop shuffle board bar area which shouldn't allowed its noticed no under 21 allowed area . But kids making much noise hard enjoy meal. feel should move shuffleboard outside patio noise pucks bother guests!

The meal itself cold even HOT! feeling food may sitting sometime before brought us. ordered bottomless mimosa wasn't even chilled! little cold drink would better!

Service very very slow when even busy when arrived few tables open seating bar area other side few tables well! 

Lastly walked feeling good all!  

NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN! Francisco amazing server highly recommend server very attentive nice destination quick lunch. venturing 2nd level sail mast type structure DT Summerlin. pleasantly surprised enter bustling mid afternoon lunch crowd music blarring.  

After browsing menu being informed $4 brunch beer specials. decided take TWO! Start off Duvel Belgium brew which good. More lager preference IPA but still tasty brew. Round two Live Free Die! Brew SF which satisfied hoppy taste buds.  

For eats CCB.  chicken burger avocado thick bacon red onion blue cheese aioli bib lettuce tomato jam fried egg over med.  Eggs sandwiches means egg all over everything especially your hands. did best impression Guy Fieri wirh elbows end wearing mountain burger.  unique combination ingredients definitely made tasty sammy . warned though messy. felt bad destroying fine white linen napkins messy hands face.  fires side perfect crispy golden brown seasoned appropriately.  natural cut skins still play.  sirracha ketchup side perfectly balanced spicy kill flavor. Nicely done indeed. 

Overall great visit. cannot wait come back fall enjoy 2nd level outdoor patio seating. keep coming back but food keeps getting worse worse. Friendly staff beautiful spot horrible food.  Please back your original quality menu. Loved place!  hearing very good things Public School 702 others wife new addition Downtown Summerlin first time last night brought friends along town.  definitely worth time took drive downtown them then drive back Summerlin dining experience.

With school themed decor atmosphere unique enough interior doesn't look just another gastrobup bar.  vide happy across entire restaurant everyone looking they'd waited all week finally there.  sure why but noticeable different many other comparable places.  waitstaff kept active all time.  never saw anyone stop although dedicated waiter several others would quickly swing table take empty plates away bring more water etc.

Onto food delicious!  Grilled Salmon Summer Succotash wife friends Huntsman burger other Shrimp Grafton Cheddar Grits.  food hot perfectly prepared.  Everything looked fantastic when brought out.  succotash salmon best anywhere.  Tell definitely public school cafeteria food.  definitely back try many other dishes menu.

Beer lots craft beer choices standing list menu plus another sheet table beers they're temporarily featuring.  note least sour beer menu.  I'd only recently heard kind beer pleased see sour options available place features craft beer part dining experience.  really need take look menu see all your standing beer choices.

Definitely reservation when go.  seat near window could see line forming door periodically people waited tables open.  reservation right restaurant's website through Yelp worked great! .  restaurant's credit hostesses seemed work through line very quickly every time built although couldn't tell if folks queuing waiting any table table reserved.

We sat inside but noticed there's ample outdoor patio seating overlooking more scenic part Downtown Summerlin.  option sit outside always plus!

Take note loud inside.  ridiculously loud but larger size dining area tied lack decor would help muffle absorb sound fosters fairly loud environment.  Even wasn't detractor.  Even though definitely public school's cafeteria volume may remind those days when your friends we're carrying conversations buzzing school cafeteria.  Again problem just know going in.  isn't place quiet intimate date.

One small misstep chalk restaurant still finding stride no salt pepper table but quickly remedied when pointed out.  We'll definitely again.  again.  If could I'd give them 4.5 stars right now assuming Public School 702 hits its stride way think don't surprised see update review five stars another visit two. Decent beer selection food pretty good. Kind weird setup  bar though. sure more fun warmer months when people actually use patio outside. Picked place girls night without knowing anything pleasantly surprised. décor really cool set mood good evening. chose sit patio which some fans but could use few more it really hot beer pong which surprised but totally fitting. Later DJ set played lots great things even started karaoke crowds request. 
FOOD Summer succotash amazing came highly recommended Jerrod S. very helpful knowledgeable enthusiastic server I really enjoyed Shrimp Grits most though expect when ordering southern favorite. 
The Mezze Plate miss wouldn't order again. deviled eggs good because didn't them myself! especially enjoyed crispy prosciutto top.
There many other things wanted try but just ran room! cant wait back try all!
DRINK AMAZING beer selection! try lot new things bit everything but don't remember seeing any sour beers. whole restaurant really big. indoor outdoor seating games giant Jenga shuffleboard making really fun casual vibe.

I ordered buffalo cauliflower truffle frites bomb! always nervous ordering cauliflower because live fear they'll soggy but came really crispy flavorful. If come back I don't live Vegas definitely those again. 

Though food delicious service really slow. recommend ordering everything once you're sitting waiting them come around again. 

The fun stuff place theme! menu comes mock notebooks brunch menu scantrons if test anxiety beware bar ceiling designed look gym floor math cards hanging clips ceiling. tv screens everywhere if you're looking place watch game head over! Bottomless drinks $15 beermosas mimosas micheladas bloody marys sat upstairs view mountains. Service amazing apps great! food delicious here. waitresses waiters very friendly. But service whole sucks. very slow refilling your drinks very slow coming back around checking making sure everything's OK. prices high. would think you're paying alcoholic beverage if strip. Hennessey Coke cost $15 then double shot another eight. think high prices supposed family mall locals mall doesn't come off way. food though definitely worth going for. crave some food items but every single time gone service horrible gone least six seven times Awesome place ! just time happy hour great apps ! also tonic house best gin tonics . ordered bunch apps all split them. bacon tatortots great really crispy still softer potato center great onion bacon flavor also truffle fries shoe string type great flavor also delicious sliders margarita pizza sliders really tasty classic slider nothing fancy but nailed pizza good simple fresh ingredients . bartenders real deal great drinks should know house made tonic could just anything . wife knowing am fan classic cocktail Negroni asked bartender if she could without hesitation she said sure great ! topped dried cherry garnish ! Dined public school first time today brunch! Good great chicken waffle burrito French toast chicken sandwich calamari! service more lovely! Peter did wonderful job being attentive! would defiantly come back! Thanks! Lexy Rupp brunch today party 7. Multiple people's orders incorrect undercooked. mom completely different entree she ordered. undercooked food waitress offered take back food put grill. cut into bitten off of. If mistaken  against health code? If disgusting should be!

Waitress nice but service lacking. Cups shouldn't empty food should come time correct full cooked! Daaaamn ps702! Back again good food! Sorry to. Haha. But we're back again time skirt steak chorizo Mac cheese. boyfriend bison burger. steak cooked medium just it. melted mouth Mac cheese pretty good but bit salty. boyfriend enjoyed burger but didn't really touch fries finished off hah.  come back drinks next time though. business lot potential real estate. food employees much. new restaurant concept. menu bit limited. beer menu also little light well off beaten path. Staff seemed distracted inattentive tables. noticed lots people waiting drinks trying flag down server. very expensive space going need step game soon attract repeat customers. Food ok service slow no 2 table took 45 minutes food come most party already eating sad. Server took forever bring check but employees nice. first pick if choice again Pretty cool place! food fine but really atmosphere. Lots space inside patio area nice large. patio also misters still sit outside when its warm out. service good. Everyone nice check sure ok. flatbread pizza ok 2x2x2 sliders good. thought fine happy hour prices but sure if would order them full price. food really only 3 stars but everything else bumped little. Seems cool place hang friends few drinks. sure back reason. Wolf Gang Puck but place busier.  don't it. Marginal best.   place good.  ok but chicken waffles ugly. Usually when place first opens hits misses.  place hit!  Didn't even know place existed until friends insisted leave happy hour happy hour.  disappointed food value service.  All great.  Great list food drink happy hour items.  Great school vibe cleaver decor including style menus.   jenga beer pong big outside patio. Fun play even watch.  back recommend spot others! biggest fan place. esthetic very cool but all going itself. service substandard food lackluster. Came lunch weekday afternoon no wait. Love ambiance decor. much bigger inside expecting. seat outside patio evening would nice feeling fill quickly dinner especially when weather nice. mezzo platter small portions hummus babaganoush olive tapenade feta roasted chickpeas pita grilled watermelon tomato stack salad bangers mash tacos couple kids meals. Don't bad thing say taste quality food. All delicious. Kids meals standard. tacos stood good. Very trendy slightly pricey but nothing absorbent ordinary area. Didn't try any beer seemed decent selection. We'll come back lunch try some new stuff I'd love come back see dinner menu. poor server slight mishap mustard but she very sweet felt super bad. Highly encourage giving try. We'll back. took folks Public School last time town. service terrific food delicious. If weather nice ask sit outside patio where may enjoy view Downtown Summerlin depending where sit some gorgeous colorful surrounding canyons. portion sizes good meat super juicy tender. especially liked mashed potatoes came meal. Mmm. folks also enjoyed dessert. really can't wrong desserts there. All told A+ dining experience. Bravo! literally come restaurant every single time Summerlin because love much!! try adventure different restaurants DTS area but far best.

The idea branding restaurant amazing. menus shape notebooks fun names some menu items reference school. love ambiance vibe only slow experience server but other then time always amazing!

I sat regular seating area bar outside....on nice day defiantly choose sit outside. see most DTS outside area which fun vibe.

Every food item amazing. also pretty great happy hour! Also good place if beer drinking lot beers draft! Summerlin neighborhood decided visit place kids gone to. pleasantly surprised big place is. Bar area large also outside area. noticed brunch specials Saturday Sunday. also $15.00 entree four refills your drink think mimosas bloody Mary's two other choices. sure would great if didn't need drive home. settled crushed velvet Moscow mule. say tasty berries big juicy. Hubby blonde beer delighted chilled nicely. place lot unique items menu if looki g traditional food place eat. shared Chorizo Mac n cheese Shrimp grits looked little intimidating but once tasted 
Amazing. Hubby ordered CCB which chicken patty type burger fried egg it. really cup tea said might better fried chicken breast. He said little dry chalky. waitress Amberlyn sweetheart very attentive came back sure things right if needed anything. would liked try desserts but very full. think would good place meet friend drinks. food delicious. fig prosciutto pizza divine but why service terrible? took 20 minutes drinks even then came time. waitress seemed she didnt know she doing. impressed staff but food good. place bookmarked VERY long time now finally try Saturday night. It seemed busy but asked server Tahni she actually said slow day. Must mean handle crowds well . sat bar watch some games TVs. 

As name suggests decor menu look classy public school. Composition book menus notepad lined paper looking napkins shelves books gloves etc . high school teacher think such Great theme! 

The food menu composition book large amounting side however much choose from. don't remember entrees because mostly appetizers pizzas but came tables around looked delicious well! We ordered ahi tuna poke bacon cheddar tots pizza buffalo cauliflower Brussels sprouts. All delicious however could probably without ahi poke. Wasn't fresh would liked be .

They beer rotations well beer left side menu. those rotations ask your server if you'd try something before getting it! If you're fan beers wine full bar! Try out! 

5 stars good food drinks good service awesome theme. Update sad say extremely underwhelmed. quality food but quality customer service. multiple times boyfriend decided bring best friend try it. 

First hostess. She opening door some middle aged women ahead us. She continued hold door party three but then stated help you? . really wanted respond well restaurant soooooo..... But decided told many where party. She then said she help people ahead would minute. When turn she asked if wanted bar dining area. chose bar because knew going tail end happy hour would able throw order quick before over. hostess said sure ahead . say myself. honestly couldn't tell if she actually walked behind menus table. just know turned around menus but hostess gone. never received usual your server minute . where next thing comes in. 

Second server. family servers immediately greet people come table within 1 minute. sat table boyfriend bathroom returned still sat waited. point where actually looking around wondering when going see server was. Kaila finally came table waters never said name. Just asked if wanted anything drink appetizers if before. told two friends first time. asked if still Happy Hour going she said no 3 30 6 30 then asked friend time was. friend looked phone 6 30 dot. Kaila oh yeah missed . honestly say first time somewhere where close happy hour server didn't offer hurry rush order would still happy hour specials. mention fact if hadn't waiting server greet would made time Happy Hour. all ordered drinks going order appetizer she walked away. When she returned beers. She poured boyfriends but gave bottle Delirium empty glass said case want glass. know may seem minor but usually servers ask if want poured glass very first time ever delirium poured glass served bottle. fancy stuck but come on. Next ordered appetizers. three different items no plates. literally sat 5 minutes waiting plates. maybe 15 minutes Kaila came over asked if wanted anything else not. told going some entrees bit. She said okay left. She came later took dinner orders seemed more pleasant. fairly certain only because she saw checking YELP. 

We disappointed service don't think back. Which disappointing really liked it. sure if because dressed casual all dolled Summerlin housewives hipsters dates thought cheap what. But all very good living family servers always tip 20% if more repeat customers. But sadly think  changed. place gross. Gross beer menu changes all time. only good thing flank steak w mac cheese but top w salt n vinegar chips its salty dead sea. Everything pretty gross place bomb several Yelpers event.

Great beers great company.  Haven't tried food yet but would love it.   What's awesome though people.  wait staff actually amazing.  Granted Monday night wasn't much going but there's many times waiter walking past we're talking dating sites... he just enters answer question had.

I mean  call service!

What say?   live music decent.   only thing think need drive bit more traffic off nights.   Perhaps might Yelp event future here?

Hard say.  just saying....  if staff served did tables Yelp event.. know it'll great. Place great fast service. Good happy hour excellent service. Nice ambience decoration. tried all appetizers wings great well sliders. Good selection beers definitely come back! Very disappointing experience first time visitor. friend suggested place she could nothing but apologize suggestion. came Wednesday afternoon place literally less 10 customers no ever came take food order. 


We intially seated drink orders taken then did even look direction staff. waiting 35 minutes someone come take order left. Due terrible lack service unable even try food. Very comfortable inviting. Service amazing ask Matt he best! food great! Saturday afternoon wasn't busy which made great first impression. going back happy hour next time. Really really cool spot!  met friend Downtown Summerlin since she hadn't there.  decided way hot hang outside.  mall completely dead quickly realized everyone restaurant!  happy hour time but 3 year old couldn't order off menu since HH only bar obviously.

Buffalo cauliflower yum!  normally hate mayo based sauces but much blue cheese kept dunking.

Grilled watermelon tomato salad more stack favorite thing.  Very refreshing flavorful some sort white cheese it looked shape white chocolate shavings...tasted feta sort but can't confirm because shape cheese shards confused but good .  Plus balsamic oil drizzle.  Loved this!

Chicken waffles waffle chile cornbread!  Very yummy.  said syrup but couldn't tell because chicken saucy cornbread savory.  good but felt needed more sweet syrup give true chicken waffles experience.

We almost fish chips but decided against because kid wanted kids menu.  thought could just try bite hers.  When kids' meal came ridiculously large bowl fries 3 small pieces best fried cod ever had.  texture coating insane inside fish still perfectly cooked I hate when dries over cooked .  took daughter's pieces daughter ate other two.  She hardly ate any fries.  Then she wanted more fish.  GREAT.  $8 meal order more fish her...but time said no fries regardless pay $8 again because just waste!  

Other being annoyed spending $16 daughter enough fish chips fault taking pieces everything great.  Very filling indulgent meal.  expensive either.

Oh service great!  least experience.  server tad slow but busy he bunch tables sure.  But even servers weren't ours super friendly!  daughter kept playing peek a boo them since near order entry computer station every single servers gave attention talked her.  Very cool impressed. few times girl friend every time service great. seat quickly sure comfortable. pizza which alway delicious. also great appetizers. wings good cauliflower tots also yummy. Check them out. fantastic place!!! 
This being first time very impressed being greeted very pleasant hostess food amazing wine chose loved much am buying case made whole night service received Peter. 
Will definitely returning. fun spot try out. atmosphere great. Very casual comfortable. food decent. service great actually highlight dining experience. server named Ron really lucky server. He great personality some laughs him.  prob should taken advice shrimp grits which he said fave item menu.

Food Roasted chicken Quinoa Salad just ok.  little bland slightly dry. 

It's Omelet tasty but omelet itself small side.  Tasty potatoes sough dough bread accompanied it. $13 

Pepperoni Pizza $13 good portion. Served hot tasty

They large outdoor seating deck outside tables through nicely spread no top each other. ceilings nice high which like even bunch people eating there...you never feel cramped noisy talk over other diners. Awesome fun place eat. Really liked admisphere.  decor menu really took back good old days  school. waiter lot fun. He gave quizzes. Haha loads fun. Normally write excellent experiences places Las Vegas absolutely need visit. Sadly today isn't case. Public School 702 Downtown Summerlin those places list long time. Ryan works crazy hours sometimes mom doesn't visit much she use to. when all three available brunch headed Public School 702 hearing some wonderful things!

Things started really well. chose sit outside view stunning. second floor.

Our server very nice he took drink orders brought promptly. Unfortunately...he gone 10 15 minutes before he even came take food order. Now actually weren't upset. Maybe shorthanded. Maybe really busy. But way is.


When food did arrive mom Ryan really good meal.


As soon saw meal poked fork...I heard crinkle. started pulling shrimp shells...several them. pieces all throughout. flagged down busser asked if he could snag water since again couldn't find no come check us. Another 10 minutes later he showed up. He then manager. 10 minutes later manager said could order something else. anyone keeping track I'd sitting inedible food nearly 30 minutes if more mom Ryan both long since finished food.



They didn't offer refund scariest part manager wasn't bothered whatsoever. don't know if normal occurrence...or if just didn't care. sat waited another meal because being polite mom really felt bad me. low blood sugar just really disappointed entire experience. Nothing apologized nothing adjusted. waiting another full 20 minutes until brought meal. then left. disappointed heard wonderful things. being over hour half...we all ready leave. hope doesn't happen anyone else. Allow give full explanation into why would give Public School 702 3 star rating rather 5 I'd given if rating Culver City location.

My girlfriend came town just relocated Long Beach Las Vegas. birthday lunch agenda. PC offers Almost Bottomless Mimosas $10 carafe which approximately 4 glasses per carafe. Instead orange juice myself another friend ordered them pineapple juice. waitress took order returned glass Mimosa friend nothing rest us. then realized she never took anyone else's order. First faux pas. 

We finally put drink orders pineapple Almost bottomless Mimosa should carafe but instead served only glass my girlfriend receives glass well minus carafe but 'garnish'. glass nada. garnish rind pineapple. slice pineapple....just rind Sprite bloody Mary garnished fried chicken . 

But before drinks arrive.....
We ordered food.   

#1. Lemon Meringue pie
#2. Tatters burned sent back kitchen buffalo cauliflower deviled eggs garnished w bacon
#3. Chorizo mac n' cheese
#4. Ahi tuna tacos
#5. Burrito unknown but over cooked. Sent back kitchen So food drinks arrived within moments another. Sounds legit except waiting awhile drinks before even putting order food. stated above asked PINEAPPLE but TWICE orange juice brought table. Food way over cooked. server blamed kitchen burned food bar delayed drinks. While realize challenging food service its part your responsibility check orders before bringing them table. 

At opposite end table watched gentleman return burger FOUR times. However did bragged Nutella dessert. Behind them food critic seemed cringe every entree app salad ordered while other side saw another couple complain send back drinks. 

I did call manager because enjoy dining Public School would love return positive experience. he very apologetic ended compensating entire meal drinks included. saying should into every restaurant find fault only your meals comp'd however establishment such Public School only better constructive feedback. first ever visit I'd whole other perspective disappointment but enjoyed fare prior quite tasty. Lemon Meringue off hizzy! first entree day. also enjoyed Buffalo cauliflowerl. chorizo mac n cheese super interesting topped sea salted potato chips chorizo actual spicy sausage. I'd sure recommend it.

Thank Nick handling issue professionally did. return requested month girlfriend give another try. Lets shoot FIVE star drinks drinks all very good! few different beers I personally recommend your fathers root beer ...so good! . also order guavalajara cocktail very good well! strong guava flavor but overpowering. almost tasted guava margarita! 
I'm giving 4 stars because service...it slow...really slow! didn't necessarily mind because talking enjoying ourselves but did lag between drinks water refills.. food amazing! beer selection great. back! Over over again ... miss place already lol. NEW FAV!! absolutely nothing negative say place. came having found while browsing yelp. checked menu decided give try. First all interior neat. love play school theme. made time happy hour 3 30 6 30 . food AMAZING. had Farro Brussels Sprout salad Crispy ahi tuna tacos 2 carafes house white BBQ Bison burger fries BBQ mustard sriracha ketchup Deviled eggs Nutella Cookie sandwich. All which amazing reasonably priced. back again sure. server Christina she AWESOME!! She took great care did other ladies helped out. party 8 reservation. All separate checks end. drink menu said happy hour prices started again 9 well appetizers. 
The food way overpriced portions give very tasty. Drinks tiny definitely worth price. 
After finished waiter Julian comes over checks. noticed some drinks happy hour price but food not. Except person party. discounted happy hour price food drinks. 
So call over say thought supposed half price 9? He says oh no  only when sit bar area... Oh really? Hmm... If true why did happy hour price no else? where does state menu?? doesn't. 
He tells he tell manager he would fix time but next time would sit bar area. Well trust if knew start would sat area. 
We very impressed won't back! Ordered Buffalo Cauliflower Brocollini Fish Chips. Buffalo Cauliflower amazing! Brocollini different. Long strands broccoli Parmesan grated over it. Lastly fish chips. fish very bland. no taste it. came tartar sauce guacamole. However presentation food amazing. fun place friends lunch dates! SCHOOLED...and liked it!

It sister's last night town decided try something new.
She said best meals trip agree!

Everything delicious!
We started 3 appetizers Mac Cheese....sprinkled potato chips! know sounds weird but really great!

We all loved entrees. Chicken waffles big hit! flavor shrimp grits fantastic.

Over all really great meal! am pissed wasted motherfathers day place when excited coming all week. 

So girlfriends party 4 sat bar sharing large table middle bar. sat down waited 10 min anyone greet us. Finally girl name Valarie came greet no menus her. waited another 5 min them. tell she very flustered couldn't maintain multiple  tables. Finally menus she walks away...WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MENUS DRINK SPECIALS LUNCH! Lets math...we almost 20 min nothing drink water! takes forever come take drink order horrible.....we asked questions she never into detail just answered quickly cuz tell she no time help decisions. She takes drink order walks away never takes any other guest drink order. WTF????? took another 10 min 1 freaken mimosa....I look around see people pissed getting no service. During time Valarie taking new tables forgets almost every step need do. She comes back WATER FINALLY!!!! 

She comes back take food order said taking friends drink order first before walk away she laughs says ok wanted walk but saw some cool food items starving $10 bottomless mimosa thought great deal! she takes drink order everyone waited another 10 min just them......IM FREAKEN FRUSTRATED POINT....Im am realizing food order going take even longer. flag down server help would nice another server knows doing. Bloody Mary super spicy put whole thing pepper Tabasco. put side never drank it. rest girls water since quickest thing quench thirst. 

Finally ordered FOOD! Tots smothered burrito Fried Califlower speck eggs mac chz ahi tacos.......The only thing good because cold items Speck Eggs Ahi Tacos. 

The tots looked charcoal sauce side.....WTF? funny thing someone actually put table???? Smothered burrito hard friend could barley cut through tortilla....the eggs tasted rotten.....It horrible. 
Anything served hot disgusting. Mac Chz dry chorizo rocks.....

We spoke manager he replaced 2 items burrito Tots. During time asked another bottomless mimosa over 15 min glass empty glass where small its stupid . 

During time couple having brunch fathers day burger made 4 TIMES! guy pissed instead gave nutella ice cream dessert....???? U SERIOUS! food critic right behind them ordered salad took 2 bites left. 

The energy surrounding weird off.  During whole time Valarie came maybe 2 times said everything ok? just said yes because upset things going just wanted speak manager. told going he said he sorry he would take care bill. name Nick...He seemed authentic apology. no deep apology other he sorry he would take care it. Maybe because he going every table around hearing same story.....Give place 2 months fire re hire solid staff handle fast pace restaurant hopefully hire people passionate brand! WACK! love going bar. Always great fast service! deep fried cauliflower amazing! Christian Sheri give best bar service! Love place. Highly recommended!!!! would love give place more stars but gotten awful service both visits. sure why see ton servers but wait 15 20 minutes even greeted table. food pretty good both times everything hot fresh.  last visit ordered hot tea brought hot water but tea wanted charged 2.50 uh really hot water 2.50.  also hate practically beg ice water. sure give third try. Outstanding Gastro Pub!! really enjoyed Great cocktails excellent Apps Buffalo cauliflower Tots bison burger truffle fries good gets!! Burger right Black Tap Bavettes!! burger must also check Deserts. Check place great vibe service too!! No idea why anyone would down vote place. Everything menu carefully made delicious. HIGHLY recommend crispy chicken sandwich shrimp grits. Food good. Service below par. Actually service sucked. saw waiter maybe 4 times 3 those times when he gave menu took order closed out. He bad unattentive someone else closed check out. place good!! ordered salmon PERFECTLY pan seared sauce good ask it. chef personally came greet share secrets. beer good Nutella ice cream cookie sandwich... ugh! Very impressed! Great theme. Food really good. ordered calamari appetizer. best ever had. great pizza which happy hour special. Also shrimp grits dish. Everyone pleased food drinks. most important part meal server Ron. He only excellent server best seen long time but way he took genuine interest amazing. He attentive just made feel special. all very impressed young man.  Ask won't sorry! Wasn't sure expect other reviews but ended enjoying dinner. tried naked wings which very crispy which love. also chicken sandwich. Also well balanced flavors enjoyable.  seem nice outdoor balcony warmer days. place super cool inside outdoor patio going rock once cool enough sit there. But place much desired. love happy hour drinks then order food towards end. did even order food because service dang slow getting drink near impossible. female bartender bar Courtney told she going charge Bill. She did she never gave drinks charged for. people right ordered appetizer incorrectly charged charged higher pricing menu. When said something Courtney she said oh menu prices changed. shouldn't mean menu prices menu should changed? person left ordered something off menu Courtney said don't anymore. Didn't just open? could something menu no longer even serve? could three different sets people sitting bar all given wrong prices wrong orders!?. Happy hour beers small. can't comment food since never ordered because knew would take long it. somewhere else eat.  place never going if don't stuff together. Best restaurant Summerlin! Possibly favorite Vegas. Can't say if food beer service best. All top notch. beer list full unique treats find anywhere else. If beer fan your home. couple times yet something food menu would rave about. guy waited first time made point stop say hey each time back in. Don't often Vegas. Definitely worth checking out!!! arrived Tuesday night around 8 pm. surprisingly busy. requested sit patio hostess said would just minute while set table up. almost positive she forgot us. stood over ten minutes. Another hostess asked if waiting someone when replied waiting table she looked around little confused. 

When finally sat table ready almost ten minutes handed menus. looked them over excited all delicious options eat drink. Lots craft beers menu see photo . asked water while looked over menus. Another server came over took drink order. boyfriend lavender vanilla ordered Cabernet. received drinks but still no water. wine fantastic boyfriends drink perfect sipping I'm really into whiskey but good . 

We ordered quinoa poblano prepared vegan no cheese broccolini prepared vegan sautéed garlic kale slaw Brussels prepared vegan brown bag potato fries not vegan but boyfriend . server came table water finally some bad news. poblano couldn't prepped vegan prepped cheese kale shaved Brussels . Back menu... opted veggie chili  created mushroom thickening base vegan . Granted 100+ degrees outside wasn't super excited but worked. boyfriend ordered chorizo Mac cheese since couldn't share poblano. food eventually arrived but chili some cream top... send back wait again. broccolini amazing. Perfectly seasoned sautéed crisp crunch. finished no time. being attacked bugs time food made table. Bug lights would ideal patio. chili awesome. came kale waffle couldn't eat but filling itself. 

Overall... good meal. little disorganized patience definitely virtue practicing evening. Would return? Yes happy hours patio laptop school books boyfriend going ideal considering convenient USB outlets located every booth. pretty new... Practice your patience... lot potential. hate give place negative review but tonight truly bad experience. 

1 bar area full. happy hour only available if sit those tables bar area. Instead taking names seat when next table opens hostess told walk around see if any tables opens up. no order chaos. driving parking lot looking parking spot. Just because first doesn't mean you'll seated first. also need luck. People came could find openings before do. 

2. told friends sign rewards program $25 off right away. waitress said no don't $25 off today $25 off next time. Later paid left confirmed  correct. noticed reward card table evens states instant rewards $25 . See attached pic cheated. 

3. didn't finish all food asked boxes. dish came dipping sauces. asked box those well. Usually any decent server would grab new ones kitchen. Tonight waitress decided just give empty sauce containers let take home remaining tiny bit sauces. See pic little its pathetic. 

So no orderly seating cheated $25 waitress cheap give couple dipping sauces. left very unhappy tonight. Great place. Beautifully designed space. Food seems ok but since never eaten can't comment. Service atrocious. ordered.

Then half food showed up. Great. 

Wolfgang Puck literally across way. Why did come here? Bad recommendation tasteless friend. lovedddddd place. 

started off buffalo cauliflower nuggets. imma myself now determined. perfect. 

then grilled watermelon heirloom tomato stack added salmon. shit delicious. grilled watermelon? yum. layered marcona almonds my fave + mint + balsamic drizzle. UGH. salmon also mega tender delicious super flakey. 

the decorations super cute too. menus composition books multiplication flash cards pinned everywhere. 

it pricey but seems vegas general. worth IMO. i'd lot if lived there. nightmare experience. 4 lunch. Server worst ever around all travels. Then told least 10 days training. don't think so. asked water waited waited wanted order find server. Yes saw standing near back just standing. once did she come back refill water see drinks. ask another server check us. Waited again finally took payment bar Katherine never came back. asked hostess speak manager when leaving reply they're busy . state guest 2 people Vegas residents. never back nor refer anyone place. new hot spot Downtown Summerlin!  Awesome look. Huge layout. Sweet outside wrap around patio. Good food. Try PBJ sliders. Very unique twist!  Tasted great. back. 
The beer selection vast alone wanting more.
The food typical bar food but slightly better. lot more menu tackled. 

We came during recess snagged couple discounted options. which dish called PB J burger bites knew expect. Greasy peanutbuttery fatty deliciousness. Which exactly got. did however feel though jelly slacking. GIVE MORE! 
Side note think description should mention AREN'T BITES... but entire burger cut into quarters. definitely expecting sliders lol

The best part place open Easter Sunday. Yay!

Service great people kind. There's nothing worse bad service but issue here. place Sunday very full but wait long drinks!  Ordered meals all bad.  pasta undercooked hard tasted starch chicken kale salad full gristle husbands short ribs all fatty!!!  He said mor pot roast.  Unreal!  manager came over said she sorry reordered different items!  pizzas good salmon much butter just rich husband did eat.  back again. also knew people sitting across also sent entire meals back all 4 them!  

They need new cooks something! several times PS702 regular stop us! food creative well executed. offer impressive tap list without overwhelming just more . Roasted Beet Salad worth trip itself Crispy Cauliflower Shrimp n Grits close second. really enjoyed everything tried. only knock way combined space echoes amplifies sound. dining section very noisy when they're half full bordering mind numbing when full. Absolutely expected enjoyed! pub section but carry over into dining area overbearing. You'll thoroughly enjoy your meal beverage but don't expect memorable conversation over dinner. Very solid four stars. food excellent five stars possible if smallish portion salmon entree.  Shrimp grits 5 stars. $17 very hearty portion. Interesting presentation grits cake state bottom bowl. Very tasty. Excellent beer selection. Very good service. beautiful patio seating however did know when sat inside. Lighting bright  bar area. Christian Randy incredible! love them take such good care me. never bad experience! keep coming back again again. Thank guys! husband decided check somewhat newer restaurant Downtown Summerlin tonight. given option sitting inside outside decided since seating shade we'd take outside. table arrangements lovely fans blowing air didn't feel warm it Vegas July know! lot tables but many felt sitting your neighbor. must add inside decorated really neat! quite few colored lighted globes hanging ceiling which LOVED! did seem awfully loud inside voices really glad chose outside! 

We immediately greeted Grace offered recommendations cocktails wines. impressed she knew both well. ended getting chardonnay she recommended unfortunately cannot remember winery but higher priced 2 perfect! love chardonnay butter under tones it! husband Crushed Velvet which incredibly delicious! She also gave couple appetizer recommendations order meat cheese platter which truly devine! prosciutto thinly sliced all fatty salami yummy! cheeses couple condiments great compliments meat. especially liked toast thinly sliced toasted making easy bite into. 

We second server Vanessa assist equally knowledgeable attentive. must say wonderful servers actually tried food drinks give opinion. husband ordered short ribs shrimp cheddar cheese grits. Both highly recommended both servers did disappoint! shrimp dish full shrimp vegetables well flavor! ended ordering glass granache. While very delicious wine would bit more kick next time dish full flavor expecting. husband thoroughly enjoyed short ribs said mashed potatoes really good hint horseradish small pieces potato it.

We just enough attention Vanessa throughout meal but much felt rushed. definitely return try something new! think initially wasn't excited menu. Boy mind changed! Great price atmosphere service food drinks! date night definitely back again. seat patio which highly recommend. great selection different draft beers upscale bar food. enjoyed Cutting Board Ahi Tacos Short Rib entree. Everything point!!! friends looking bottomless mimosas place landed here. Basically 4 10$ which isn't bad considering liquor them 4 trick. BLT steak salad pretty good besides iceberg lettuce. service great school house theme cool. definitely must if you're area Came boyfriend happy hour. Great space good service nice outdoor patio too! Located Downtown Summerlin outdoor shopping center. 

Sat bar. He couple beers. practically bottomless beermosas which includes 4 glasses sooo good!! . also shared white bean hummus delicious . We'll definitely back try other items menu. tonight great small window opportunity meal wife 702 perfect! Hailey server flipping amazing!  She funny knowledgeable provided unexpected element fun evening!  Bonus she's lefty! service food amazing! recommendations perfect! tots fantastic all crushed velvet GOOD! ordered bison burger cooked perfection! favorite part dinner spectacular service received! Everyone great atmosphere pretty cool too! Definitely coming back! Located Downtown Summerlin...We during 1st anniversary Downtown Summerlin. crowded everywhere. 25 minute wait even though many tables open. waitress said didn't expect crowded today. problem because take your cell # text when your table ready...so walked around Art Festival Farmers Market. worth wait! Both meals delicious! just wish room Nutella Ice Cream Sandwich closest place pub neighbourhood. great location great beers food games lovely outside area. Perfect large groups informal parties. struggled giving three star review knowing should probably giving them two. planned brunch date girlfriend past Sunday because looking place both never somewhere offered some bottomless mimosa's! Now knowing Sunday Brunch times always busy ahead booked reservation through YELP including notes outdoor seating balcony would preferred. Once arrived told don't guarantee outdoor seating first come first served. Initially told didn't anything available then girl comes back says did but sun. said sure let's try see if going work didn't moved back inside. Once seated greeted very nice waiter new did best he could. He disclosed multiple times really backed service may seem slow. bottomless mimosa option guess offer where beer yuck! traditional way which orange juice. asked orange juice only receive exact opposite which beer! add insult injury already annoyed wait almost 15 minutes drink just completely over entire situation quite frankly. food took forever which simple eggs benedict pizza smothered breakfast burrito! burrito TRASH cut into only find hash browns all burnt egg hard. Gotta kdding me? appetizer's came main course which another strike. just entire train wreck could but wasn't happy all being first visit. must've caught them off day because entire experience ridiculous. waiter nice felt bad he new no control  only reason getting 3 stars 2. great happy hour dinner experience Peter Sheri helping us. Peter suggested great beer choices Sheri's hospitality comes second none. food great never disappoints! high hopes place... Great concept BUT horrible horrible service! Over over over again tried place every time AWFUL service! 8 bartenders behind bar 6 people bar no drink? While bartenders drinks redbull people wait helped. try again sit outside table once again no would acknowledge not exaggerating almost hour. No would ask if needed drink food. Servers walk over over again. place JOKE! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible service! amazing concept... Great outdoor seating great setup place honestly lot potential.... But management needs Fire whole staff try again!!!! Sadly disappointment. Having wanted try original downtown LA location longest time just never getting chance Public School 702 probably more anticipated restaurant openings year. new location Downtown Summerlin sits upper level between Crave yet open second Shake Shack. pretty large space lot seating good size bar area outdoor patio well. But even all gets busy you'll likely wait table. just 2 people 7 30 Wednesday night wait still tipped 30 minutes.

After being seated handed regular notebook style menu quite few appetizers all kinds entrees burgers chicken waffles. also handed separate list current rotating tap beers.  favorite parts PS702. only normal beer list all craft offerings but rotating stuff seems filled unique even some hard find limited release stuff. If you're beer drinker though they've plenty cocktails wines too.

Since only 2 pretty much every appetizer menu sounded good decided few items share then split dinner. started off some smaller items Speck Eggs Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. just $6 must try starters opinion. eggs perfectly boiled creamy yok filling little piece proscuitto nice salty crispy touch. buffalo cauliflower excellent. few different versions other places California where seems more popular PS702's excellent. thicker breading served piping hot sauce side instead tossed.

The other appetizers tried little bigger side. Mezze Plate huge $8 includes 5 different things pick off dip huge stack thin crispy pita like bread. favorite things marinated feta something never anywhere else before crispy chickpeas. also really enjoyd Chorizo Mac Cheese. most expensive starter $9 but well worth it. pasta cooked perfectly super cheesy there's plenty chorizo even though thought strange first salt vinegar chips top added both flavor texture.

By time pretty full but order Fried Jidori Chicken Green Chili Cornbread Waffles already way. Sadly didn't impress nearly much appetizers especially $22 price tag. personally really liked slightly spicy waffle cornbread texture but wifey wasn't fan. even though flavor chicken excellent mushy only part leg bone in. gravy good flavor well but because chicken soggy made whole dish just overly mushy. chicken crispy would huge hit me.

Unlike lot other reviews service excellent. even found later during meal waiter training. He did excellent job though no complaints all area.

PS702 little pricy side especially when drinks but world crazy. both getting drinks then adding 4 appetizers main entree only spent $90 tip. Besides main chicken waffles dish being bit let down well worth say PS702 new favorites Downtown Summerlin can't wait back. food delicious! mac cheese appetizer blown away yummy was! French toast day which strawberry cream huge! boyfriend breakfast burrito he finished all it! food amazing reason rated four because literally forgotten server. ordered drink never came until ask another server it. Good customer service best dining experience just wasn't happy experience could if actually attention paid Ask Selina! She gave excellent service. mimosas always cold full! She attended right away any request. fabulous brunch sunny weather. both heaters fans outdoor tables. food quality. breakfast burrito chicken sandwich tater tots starter. Freshly made delicious! good. Extremely sloooow service. didn't drinks until food came out. Fries cold. Everything just meh. wouldn't come back. Good food good beer big Jenga shuffleboard more want?  service hit miss but great last 2 3 times there. Love happy hour menu! Lots unique touches great comfort food. Wasn't packed Monday happy hour. Food came quick. little bottle sprite but fountain drinks no refills. Good place take kids. Everything fantastic brunch Saturday! delicious coffee served cool little cup free refills. ordered Jidori fried chicken jalapeño cornmeal waffles salmon succotash ahi tuna salad eggs Benedict pizza. fried chicken moist delicious gravy side cornmeal waffles highlight dish. pizza world delicious. thin crust pizza egg hollandaise sauce it. salmon moist perfectly done. succotash citrus sauce unexpected delight. Even standard ahi tuna salad really good. am looking forward coming back again trying everything! Public school fun restaurant infusing culinary accomplishment foods found public school cafeteria. pleasantly surprised delicious meal. Generally strongly themed restaurants decore overshadows taste But public school both surprisingly well done. started artisan meats cheeses bacon tater tots. tater tots simply amazing. Obviously hand crafted in house fried combination hashed potatoes cheese bacon pleasing but pairing sriracha ketchup perfect. meats cheeses just ok. only wow platter goat cheese marmalade. main course chicken waffles bacon red eye gravy syrup hot sauce. highly impressed cornmeal waffles sauces used bring course together. combination sweet salty spivey sauces cut through traditional home style dish. loved meal despite chicken being ordinary under spiced. All in all great meal slightly inflated price. actually heard place months now friends ate here. wanting but don't usually find myself Downtown Summerlin. finally see myself wonderful restaurant hype about. friends came dinner. 

Atmosphere blew away! Modern clean dim. didn't think restaurant big. given 3 options dine bar booth patio. chose booth surprised see wall outlet booth well 2 USB ports. interior amazing which made reminisce grade school. Booths set look study booths. Overhead models planets wall front books. dinning area definitely reminded library. course free WiFi too. Behind kitchen which looked school cafeteria. menus composition notebooks check mini clipboard. Napkins looked binder paper notepads. haven't checked bar looked but patio gave really nice view could play couple games giant connect four beer pong sandbag toss.

Food little pricey side but would expect fancy outlet mall Downtown Summerlin. ordered Thai Shrimp Noodle Salad which pretty big portion. took bite immediately rushed throughout mouth flavor. impressed. friend ordered tacos. meat those tacos also very flavorful. other friend ordered Crispy Chicken Sandwich which he said pretty good. French fries deliciously ketchup interesting taste. little spicy kinda mixing ketchup Sriracha. ice cream cookie sandwich dessert. surprisingly really big able satisfy 3 us. Cookies soft sweet chocolate chips them. vanilla ice cream prevented chips being sweet. crunch outside added nice texture. liked overall quality food justified price. 

Staff service excellent! everyday greeted general manager which surprised me. didn't name but apparently new management? don't know before compared now but think great now! server Lissie she's just adorable. Haha. Very nice always sincere smile face. Very helpful knowledgeable explaining dishes drinks well giving recommendations. She even gave introduction restaurant!

It exceeded expectations I'd sure come back again try rest delicious food. I'd definitely wanna come back happy hour!  sure! lunch few months ago good friend. chorizo mac cheese appetizer.  Loved it. Then she ordered pan seared salmon Meatballs linguine. Overall great place great service. Can't wait appetizer again. actually gotten eat restaurant because all 3 time gone chose close before posted closing time. didn't seem care business anytime just said didn't enough business stay open. returning reason. dining adventure continues through Downtown Summerlin. Public school 702 offers Brunch weekends along regular menu. restaurant large space enormous outdoor patio. Indoors room high ceilings hard surfaces but conversation friendly. 
At check requested booth only waited few minutes cleared. Service prompt server offering water while perused menu.. Refreshments include bottomless Bloody Mary's Mimosas. If drink more two becomes money saver. Review large chalk board entrance if beer lover.

We chose Ahi tuna Tacos starter. four order avocado salsa lemon aioli served crispy wonton shells. Ahi Tuna fresh flavorful. shells provided nice crunch.
Chicken Sausage Cheddar Grits Brunch menu come two fried eggs blistered tomatoes grilled corn bacon greens beer sauce. chicken sausage little heat entire dish nice mix fill up. 
Grilled Salmon Summer Succotash regular menu. server did ask degree doneness salmon however prepared satisfaction cooked all way through nice grill marks. salmon served roasted  vegetables edamame corn squash citrus butter.
Public School 702 Happy Hour bar extends part patio. Since patio faces east would recommend when sun move across roof adds some shade. Ceiling fans help circulation. beer menu wide variety choices. 
A return visit must further explore offerings. Even though husband kept referring a damn hipster restaurant both really enjoyed experience meal. 

We great waitress start things off! name Vanessa she wasn't total food beer snob she made great recommendations menu made sure positive experience. 

We started drinks husband kiiiiind beer snob he enjoyed selections. crushed velvet LOVED IT. Great drink freshly made superb balance alcohol mixer. super impressed. 
We chose buffalo cauliflower appetizer awesome! Flavorful batter cauliflower extra buffalo sauce if wanted them spicier. highly recommend appetizer everyone. 
I Huntsman burger entree good. little undercooked but cool that. Very hearty carmelized onions help balance flavor. husband wild mushroom telaggio pizza. He loved it! Again great balance flavor. 
We finished off meal Nutella ice cream cookie bacon brittle. Yum. Don't need say much else. 

It really positive experience definitely back. only con music really loud. maybe just getting old. came really excited first Sunday brunch since moving Vegas. heard great things decided check out. seated right away outside patio which cool area but took solid 20 min before anyone even acknowledged took drink order. even then person took order admitted she wasn't server but would started didn't wait any longer. actual server Jaimie didn't come over until food already delivered table. Its unfortunate because food amazing atmosphere cool especially patio area. Just wish experience better. work food bev well don't lot Sunday's off really looking forward this. roommate going order shots another round drinks even couple more apps but she dropped off check without even asking if anything more needed. just finished drinks elsewhere most Sunday Funday. Would consider coming back again assuming maybe she just having bad day next time maybe experience would better. always down restaurant promises craft beer Public School small chain handful locations wanted try them while still Vegas.

First recommend work host stand arrangement. hostess kindly opened door table info hand via tablet. moment ill timing large group folks came inquiring wait which left Mimi standing several minutes. space isn't really designed loitering very awkward moment confused whether seat yourself not.

Other food pretty good! ordered buffalo cauliflower appetizer which fabulous. also opted salads dinner  my Mimi beet salad Kale caesar salmon. salads also excellent.

Service wasn't best. server nice but little slow. ordered beer only come back 10 minutes later say tapped then took another 10 minutes bring replacement sample. Eh.

I did booths sitting both outlet USB plug in.  perfect shopper wants break eat time recharge phone. 

Overall shabby mall restaurant! place proves all location

Been few times...it OK bar setup but honestly gets traffic does because location lack competition. Nothing spectacular place don't always having deal crowd just drink. building can't handle bring in.

Would rather else where. Food ok great better options immediate area Ate second time girl. Service good usual food consistent. Lobe Bangers 'n Mash! girl gets fish n chips. chorizo Mac n cheese very good. Apple Jack tonight. Very tasty cocktail. miss version Moscow Mule. Crushed Velvet but rotate specialty drinks. We'll back again. first time last night. tried once before but wait long. Decided try again but earlier. Arrived 5 00 still wait 20 25 minutes table. 

However wait worth it. sat patio view great. chicken cornbread waffles. awesome. definitely back. review strictly brunch. came pm Sunday prime brunch time ordered bottomless mimosas food. Just began eat food server came table informed restaurant orange juice. maybe 10 minutes received first mimosa *had* known running out. matters worse table next asked why informed oj fresh squeezed...so someone just busy squeeze. 
Public school don't offer mimosas Sunday if can't deliver.
Side note food delicious server pretty awful but could circumstances. Great place first timer am thankful cowork recommended place. truly enjoy visit service great food awsome. can't wait come back again second time wife loves place too. We'll  back soon... give 4 stars just Happy Hour. Ordered Buffalo Cauliflower Cheddar Tots knowing great reviews definitely hit home run choice. Great beers. Nice atmosphere awesome theme. Going try regular menu next time town. really love here! chicken sandwich made drool all over place good! Also beer selection wonderful! Place great! Great tasting food great drinks staff great! waiter Peter hooked hilarious if come ask him! quite experience eating here. didn't know anything before friend suggested eat since she before.

The guy holding door open dressed pretty casually. didn't really know he worked but he ended seating us. presented drink food menu. selection beers weren't vast but seemed real delicious. personally Nitro beer ordered crispy buffalo cauliflower speck eggs appetizers. entrees friend ordered shorty bowl moody burger. 

The appetizers came first. crispy buffalo cauliflower came good amount indeed crispy. little bit cheese between breading cauliflower. speck eggs although good only 4 halves bought us. When entrees came really excited burger came quinoa salad shorty bowl. burger really juicy couldn't enough it. shorty bowl some real delicious potatoes bottom bowl short ribs other add ins. 

Our service par. waitress checked periodically which greatly appreciated. food good overall but just bit pricey. all 6 items near $80. Although good would rather spend much two people regularly. Four words Chipolte Mac Cheese.  Hands down BEST mac cheese entire life!!  mac cheese appetizer then entrees chicken waffles Huntsman burger.  chicken fantastic flavor cornmeal waffle awesome!  Huntsman burger underdone char outside nothing balance strong cheese sauce bit off putting.  probably wouldn't order again. 

For dessert brownie nutella cookie sandwich.  nutella cookie sandwich twice size burger pecan brittle amazing!  really didn't taste nutella due other flavors but would definitely again and share 3 other people .  brownie less brownie more fudge very dense top brownie seemed dark chocolate icing.  being fan dark chocolate wasn't fan but husband liked it.  

Overall would definitely come back... might just order mac cheese entree! First time Phoenix Az.. great food drinks love Penny Lane Wiskey... Amy awesome great service very consistent. I'd definitely come back!!! best way describe Public School 702 high class pub.  located nice part Summerlin kind hidden upstairs mall.  But once immediately experience intended vibe.  

The menus look notebooks appropriate memorabilia filling walls give off public school atmosphere.  very good craft beer list including main stays rotating options write chalkboard entrance.  beers towards expensive side $7 $9 but offer rare varieties local brews worth some cases.

The food surprisingly above average.  why look restaurant high class pub.  food wasn't just bangers mash fish chips.  quinoa salad which both large delicious.  Another member party lamb burger another kale salad.  also shared nice looking watermelon tower salad.

Overall food great beer selection great Happy Hour supposedly great food specials $1 off beers location great.  Try place if you're looking better Yard House. love decor place. themed school. menus scantron composite notebook themed napkins look pieces paper. 

For appetizer crispy buffalo cauliflower bites those things world good! entree CCB burger packed full flavor couldn't enough. Honestly everyone's meals looked good. can't wait back. new spot sure! know when walk into room people just kind stare second because feel shouldn't something? Then just brings some awkwardness in? Yeah. happened. because looked lost? because younger sister me? sure. But tell next family came treated much more respect wasn't any awkwardness all. because white? sure. hate pulling race card but  felt case.

So start that. great.

We asked sit outside. side empty tables shade. other side tables bright Las Vegas sun wasn't really wanted moment. already sweating. asked server if could moved something she uhh well can't move myself talk other girls . that. But she kept saying over over. ended saying something dude chick seated hella awkward would much rather talk again. finally someone else seated inside.

It pretty slow when went. Saturday afternoon. When seated probably left alone 15 minutes. ready walk already. Finally server came gave some room temperature water no ice tiny glasses. think standard but if we're only drinking water then shouldn't bigger glasses? ICE? bar. sure larger glasses somewhere. When she came ordered sat waited food. 

Shortly food starts coming out. First poke. alright. flavor looking for. needed some salt something. didn't salt pepper table kind sucked. Forgot ask though. then buffalo cauliflower which wasn't bad all. see why most popular items. also bacon tater tots forgot name exactly okay. margherita pizza came cold. Don't know why cold. cheese pretty solid pretty lackluster. hipsterness place didn't fun seemed.

Overall experience wasn't great. wouldn't come back. Even leaving felt being judged something stepping place all. felt unwelcomed start should listened gut feeling. Waste money waste time. Quickest way lose business permanently misinformed phone very specific question allow dogs your patio ? told yes brought dogs then told No upon arrival.
This pathetic level customer service unacceptable. If girl phone didn't know she should asked but just appears there's zero uniformity training. place tucked away overlooking cool quad space Crave Wolfgang Puck. really neat space perfectly situated people watching long brunches. loved green chile chicken waffles peanut butter jelly french toast pretty good too. nearly bottomless mimosa best ever had clearly hand pressed fresh juice. staff also amazing really great customer experience should take pains ensure every guest having good time. wish could write food drinks but unfortunately can't. sat girlfriend brought menus water. waited almost 20 mins server! kept walking no decided come. table seated front server came right away. should pulled race card but im type person. refuse think way. did tell girl way seated 20 mins still no server! But table front server right away.  very poor disrespectful restaurants part she apologized. But NEVER EVER come place. Instead crave downstairs GREAT time! thought whole Public School theme dope. nice chill restaurant. lunch specials actually GOOD  extensive. fish chips Parmesan truffle fries bomb thought dope games enjoy outside while drink conversate. server friendly helpful. may back friends happy hour but would back dinner. enjoyed buffalo cauliflower Moscow mule fine however both salads steak ahi skimpy price. Plus steak asked medium came extremely rare specifically asked no tomatoes ahi which waitress forgot. loud too.  I'd try some beers try some other appetizers sometime. Best pizza pretty much ever had. dad lunch very pleased Italian chopped salad pepperoni pizza. ambiance fun very well done. service excellent. know some people issues but server amazing. But usual few cons experience. truly would give place 4.5 stars if could. 

Cons Loud. Loud. Loud. If friends having some cocktails wouldn't mind but being dad made any lengthy conversation difficult. 

Electrical outlets table.  right technology obsessed folks there. individual outlet most tables USB ports. sure huge thumbs most but freaked made sad quite honestly.  

Managers? least 8 men walking around plaid shirts super important iPads things hands just tapping away meetings over meetings over there. just random bizarre.


But none food service let's face  why restaurant. hands down back. really want place am wavering between 3 4 stars sit bar enjoying Ballast Point Sculpin. 
It's great concept but just don't feel all love tonight. 
Beers bottle better what's tap. Some excellent beers found here. Don't expect find light beer any kind defiantly no Corona. 
Order buffalo cauliflower signature item nice sized. 
The tortilla soup ok 
I fine place another try down road its great company Downtown Summerlin. 
Want great hard find beer place maybe nibble beer justify second staff really good right beginning. enjoyed fried cauliflower adult tater tots... Yum!
It fun Ladies Night Out good place take your friends casual fun night out. Really place! Great vibe food atmosphere drink selection! Good happy hour! food place fantastic. twice now Huntsman burger both times... bacon course. can't over delicious is. boyfriend bison burger once which he loved salmon which perfectly cooked.  also buffalo cauliflower which fits great info current cauliflower obsession.  favorite thing though may Brussels sprout slaw.  trying recreate home all time.  beer selection awesome fun.  servers ok but sometimes adapt hipster attitudes top dress code. isn't Brooklyn keep clothes but lose tude.  biggest complaint... frickin loud.  music would great if could hear better because good playlist.  crowd noise overbearing.  hope find way lower but ceiling high doubt possible.  sure nicer huge patio. LOVE place 2 brunch visits. wonder if dinner bad since honestly brunch GOOD here. 

Ambiance 5 5 casual trendy fun public school theme. space large which nice since able easily accommodate huge 10ppl group short notice. 

Service 4 5 friendly but bit slow times.

Food Chorizo Mac Cheese 5 5 GOOD. Creamy savory yummy goodness. Scrape bottom plate goodness. Also excellent value. I'd just  meal. Bacon Tater Tots 5 5 Also very yummy. crispy side buttery flaky inside. GOOD. Speck Eggs 3 5 Good but ordinary. Fried Jidori Chicken Green Chili Cornbread Waffles 5 5 Delicious chicken perfectly seasoned crispy outside juicy inside. Waffle maybe typical texture but remember cornbread. Still very good. Also HUGE portion. Stuffed French Toast 5 5 Very good. Sweet but overly sweet. Shrimp Grits 5 5 Perhaps best shrimp grits ever had. grits didn't come bowl mush but rather something grit cake  a little crunch outside creamy inside. Almost bottomless Mimosa 2 5 fine but mimosa mimosa. Nothing special. definitely loses bloody mary. Almost bottomless bloody mary 10 5 OMG. came pickled garlic a...chicken wing. NO JOKE. Solid spicy kick sweet. swear next time just coming bottomless bloody mary.  4 bloody marys 4 chicken wings. $10. more ask brunch? Amazeballs. Food excellent. fried chicken waffles. bison burger adobo tacos. Would order all three again. finished off lemon dessert. good. Service prompt without being overbearing. Comfortable atmosphere without being stuffy. Would consider bringing kids next time around. back. solid performance service food. brunch most enjoyed bacon cheddar tots good anytime day! speck eggs standard solid starters. note tots spectacular tots tots weird texture still good but over moon good.

I've 2 brunch entrees far highly recommend both dishes light other richer. First beet salad arugula added poached egg top fave. presented prettily flavorful light. delicious pomegranate dressing top all off. poached egg took notch! think favorite overall dish PS702.

On rich side chicken sausage cheddar grits lots big flavors grilled tomatoes grilled corn bacon. eggs over medium let gooey goodness melt down into grits. really enjoyed chicken sausage dish. yummy many starters finish but reeeaaalllyy wished could have!! hint fill ing. definitely recommend bottomless mimosas keep them coming.

Great happy hour lots variety choose from beer wine half liter food specials. Enjoyed buffalo crispy cauliflower most! buffalo sauce provides good kick pants. Give Sriracha ketchup try cauliflower dug combo! Overall enjoyed each visit different ways although service slow friendly but slow refills ordering next rounds patient keep coming back more. Stopped Sunday brunch. Peter awesome point throughout. If you're hopping around downtown Summerlin want good food cold drink recommend stopping Public School only school never thrown of. super excited try place but complete let down. seated promptly wasn't very busy quite few staff members working however some reason sat 15 20 minutes without anyone attending us. mentioned previously lot employees constantly walked right past us. just grabbed belongings left.. super disappointed! first tell ok wanted give second chance waitress really rude but food good. Third time said closing 10 11 believe showed 9 o'clock already closing which unfortunate place bookmarked because looked interesting reviews piqued interest. Although bookmarked never found time urge visit place until recently. group friends wanted meeting discuss snowboarding trip weekend done all planning decided hold meeting here. 

I'm sure expected place but decor appearnace wise pretty cool. things brought back nostalgia flashcards used 3rd grade hanging. ceiling above bar resembled gym floor. globes math problems chalkboard beside Locker rooms aka bathrooms. menus neat look old school composition notebooks.

The food seemed all pretty unhealthy food did many items could cater pescetarians vegetarians vegans. 

Very cool decor inside although menu left feeling guilty inside. Freekin awesome.   lunch.  appetizer hummus. chick peas amazing. bread soft doughy.  roasted chicken salad delicious too. Chicken perfectly cooked dressing great too.  shared Nutella cookie. Omg.  best deserts ever Great food twist. twice prices reasonable food delicious. easily made reservation walked right sat right way. Service great rushed even though place very busy. look forward eating again soon! Food wonderful but service area definitely needs step up! Waited 20 minutes drinks more time going here. Once them they're watered down! Love whole theme restaurant. 

The cutting board delicious well steak Mac cheese dinner!! Stumbled across awesome spot while wandering downtown Summerlin. Even though busy sat quickly. server Melissa great. Never ran water checked reasonable intervals without being bothersome. Everyone friendly seemed enjoying where worked. 

I ordered flat steak chorizo Mac cheese entree tater tots app. Those tots feeling amazing. want order more just order it's seven single order if don't want end fork war having awkward moment when only left... steak incredible. came exactly ordered no steak knife necessary which amazing accomplishment cooks flat iron steaks very tough. just right amount truffle butter top just delicious. mac also very yummy. much mum decided she would just eat mine. 

Now dessert! If bacon lover isn't? need order Cookie ice cream sandwich! Right now! epic. mean... Nutella spread chocolate chip cookies vanilla ice cream encrusted BACON! 6 bucks! 

I definitely returning when back Vegas. staying casino next shopping mall came dinner night.

Server friendly attentive she came back several times sure happy.

I ordered water gave huge bottle water. exhausted past two weeks travels dehydrated ended finishing whole bottle water myself. I drive later night pick friend wasn't going order any alcohol anyway but drink menu looked nice. I wasn't hungry but needed eat dinner time ordered ahi tuna poke chorizo Mac cheese.  Ahi tuna poke server's favorite thought going but still enjoy it. far Hawaii nothing it. 

Chorizos Mac cheese way salty me. really force myself eat thought needed put food stomach but couldn't. server asked if wanted take but said salty eat. wasn't expensive all did eat 5 bites going pay but she kindly took bill.

Overall good experience bad best condition fully enjoy restaurant. Very bad service DJ's joke .... Blasting music then quiet then blasting.... Then sound checks hour into set!! Ha ha ha ha.   Place empty 4th July..... CPK packed !! If want try come fast ... won't last long !!! come back Public School twice since first review ecstatic each every time.

The ahi tuna happy hour tacos melt your mouth delicious. splurged them friend before main dish bangers mash. bangers mash good but good some other items had.

My last visit ate shrimp grits BETTER shrimp grits Charleston SC. AH MAY ZING. ate ate ate until burst because just couldn't enough. grits come fried patty form but minute take fork crumbles into succulent grits bit crunch outside. shrimp cooked perfectly sauce pour over all good I'd eat soup itself!

We've meat cheese platter fish chips too. 
Everything delicious.

The only downside when weather cold enjoy sitting outside inside NOISY. isn't going where wind down long day. probably your headache worse.

Overall absolute favorite restaurant Las Vegas. during happy hour few apps very unique great flavor! service great well atmosphere. Quality craft restaurant worth checking if DT summerlin! Came first time over year. remember being better... ordered Moody Burger good all. 
The horseradish aioli way overpowering instantly gives bad breath take bun off just eat burger. burger tasted charcoal too. fries yummy though. 
My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict pizza. SALTYYYY much salt needed tomatoes avocado something dull salt. 
The beer selection decent. Sad rid Dawn Red beer. 
It wasn't very good may try again someday but odds won't. 
Service slow but servers nice...
This place expensive you're getting. wouldn't recommend came NYE dinner. Wasn't sure if going busy made reservations. Come find busy all. Upon entering restaurant host greeted then asked many. told 4 reservations. She then said oh OK then showed iPad lot names then said see your name? pointed name then she walked table. son sat down then realized table dirty! Food crumbs everywhere table. waited 10mins before stopped someone ask them please clean table off. water container bottle 4 glasses.... water warm. sure likes warm water but don't asked ice. ordered food which didn't wait long come but no silverware napkins. waited waitress come back but she didn't stopped someone else ask that. waitress nice don't wrong just felt since wasn't busy all service table host should top game. 3 stars experience had. would gave 5 star because food awesome! ordered Mac cheese cutting board pepperoni pizza. food tasty. would try place again because food but just hoping experience lot better if decide again. server Emily sweetest most attentive server group very long time. Definitely great team member. Restaurant seemed very busy but she made night. First time kids. ordered bison burger PB J burger skirt steak tacos chicken quinoa salad. appetizers fried calamari fried cauliflower. Everything 10! Service amazing food incredible. Andrew amazing server well. Definitely new favorite. Came girls night enjoyed very much. restaurant located inside downtown Summerlin. decor concept restaurant both aligned very well made feel school. girl friends sat patio lovely. food great brought little wait. give 4 stars because though food restaurant great feel server could better. She spoke really fast somewhat short answers. Didn't really smile which made feel she didn't really want there. Other everything else perfect. located beautiful location decor beautiful but it. Menu items very common food quality very average. wouldn't again simply because price way high value. Public school 702... First time AMAZING! only open few weeks happy stumbled upon place. Downtown summerlin lucky place. server extremely helpful seemed really know menu. few sample beers prior deciding favs. recommended try buffalo cauliflower truffle steak salad bison burger. All which very flavorful. server SELINA she incredibly sweet very helpful. decor inside decorated just school setting nice touch. little details customers want come back experience. First time checking Public School already instant fan. Peter amazing he took time school menu took time answer all questions. Definitely back see Peter. beer selection amazing food really good. Everything menu spicy! Even if doesn't say it! struggled find something order begin settled grilled salmon veggies. took bite end that. Way spicy. boyfriend nice enough switch meals me. He ordered burger. took bite couldn't eat either! spicy! He agreed both meals spicy and he likes spicy food . waiter kind enough offer menu order something else but declined because knew wouldn't find anything else cared for. 
We no problem service. seated promptly waiter attentive always refilling water glasses. atmosphere very cute detailed school house theme. menus presentation dishes plates themselves very appealing wanted take them home. However WAY loud there. room extremely echoey begin throw loud music TV noise top that. truly felt back school cafeteria that's good thing .
Bottom line would return. Great place. Everything ever eaten amazing. Great place happy hour. Lively atmosphere great service. Faro salad Chili w Green Chili cornbread paired Uinta 22nd Anniversary Sour beer .  Tasty tasty cornbread awesome!  Vanessa server very attentive knowledgable.  exploring summerlin saw restaurant. Very cool decor theme.  breakfast burrito which bland. asked hot sauce no Mexican hot sauce available.  friend chicken waffles which smothered gravy also very marginal. Might fun place drinks... While looking nice outdoor place eat came upon PS702. Great place great service great food
We edamame humus beer flight which came promptly delicious.  followed pizza chicken sandwich again spot on.  waitress Selina gave great suggestions followed throughout without going over top.  Can't wait come back cauliflower buffalo bites delicious. Ordered them each time come really tasty. Did care humus plate wasn't tasty creamy. more peanut butter consistency rather creamy. happy hour specials decent. Decent portions decent prices. Definitely cauliflower bites those delicious. place pretty empty Sunday 11 AM brunch. brunch menu modestly priced around $15 per entrée. almost bottomless drinks $15 choose between Mimosa bloody Mary michelada beermosa which awesome creation beer orange juice elderflower. bloody mary mix sweet tasted tomato sauce put over pasta. delicious! Would definitely visit again Came Wednesday night surprisingly busy. wait table 10 minutes long once sat service extremely slow waiter only came table three times once greet once take order once paid when pitcher water table needed refill took little while someone refill it. 

I ordered chorizo shrimp delicious! spicy but still light kick. date bangers mash didn't look good but he liked  all mattered The atmosphere very great. kind noisy hip modern chill etc. Everyone works very friendly young accommodating which love! But 1 star knocked off because server didn't come around enough times when server alert aware around. Public School 702 type refined brand you'd expect chain restaurant which but manages feel more small scale chef driven spot thanks modern menu great craft brews. gastropub you'll find pub bar fare hit spot bangers mash consisting snappy chicken herb sausages hearty bacon brussels mash. Other top dishes include chicken wings crackly crispy exterior adobo tacos come two roasted chicken two short rib tacos massive farro brussels salad pan seared scallops.

They serve brunch weekends too. French toast varies but blackberry lemon curd version tried equally sweet tart. Even better fried jidori chicken green chili cornbread waffles. Well seasoned thin crispy crust chicken sat atop mildly spiced savory waffles covered gravy full bacon bits. Topped fried egg brunch version differs regular menu which more chicken no egg.

Unfortunately some dishes fall flat. wasn't fan broccoli salt vinegar chips mac cheese. grits shrimp white cheddar grits dish soupy runny liking.

Their beer list changes frequently but they've some great ones menu Jommegang Ommegang a Belgian style dark ale Parabloa Firestone Walker a Russian imperial stout .

Service solid few times gone but restaurant large long rectangular layout see servers struggling race bar pick drinks race kitchen other end grab food race back tables. think all servers act food runners bussers amount work isn't conducive great customer service. issue management layout more anything but often reflects poorly servers. dad paid visit Public School 702 last night check new brews Left Coast Brewing released. dad bit beer connoisseur trying new beers along some good food right alley. new beers being launched 7 early enough enjoy happy hour recess call it. 
Right off bat noticed nice selection craft beers server Jared extremely knowledgable when dad expressed desire try new stout. ordered many different beers during happy hour left coast tasting don't remember but everything delicious! 
Now food speck eggs which deviled egg prosciutto mezze plate which consisted pita bread hummus baba ganoush dipping crispy buffalo cauliflower franks hot sauce bleu cheese dipping sliders. sliders weren't anything special but enjoyed everything else got. only gripe cauliflower dipping sauces. place markets itself gastropub would nice see sauce create themselves.
Overall place gets thumbs girl definitely back! Food good. Appetizer portions way small. I'd recommend just skip appetizer burger. food control good loved brunch drink specials. CCB Bison Burger. tomato jam CCB best ever had. service amazing server Tyler super knowledgeable menu top it. New fav spot took theme all def say that! Lol whole place decorated school things even menus look notebooks. 

So brunch hubby parents New Year's Day. sat outside patios upstairs really perfect soak sun fresh air being couped red rock casino resort days! slightly nippy even turned outdoor heater booth which nice touch. overall service really good!!
We ordered edamame hummus appetizer handheld Cobb stuffed French toast regular breakfast. 
The best thing honestly hummus scrapped completely clean delicious grilled flat bread pieces served with. Next hubby shared Cobb sandwich. very flavorful since packed ingredients. little messy due fried egg top but always fried egg top wins girls vote. 
I say few misses. aforementioned egg quite bit completely uncooked whites. quinoa salad  sandwich completely flavorless. sure why wouldn't dress salad all. MILs crispy smashed potatoes eggs impressively crispy looking but no salt we're disappointing. FIL said stuffed French toast wasn't stuffed didn't taste all but looked nice least. 
The extras bunch beer pong tables outside those patios shuffleboard table inside bar def seems fun place happy hour. Great selection draft beer. really concept place. wish just larger location . when gets crowded feels packed sardines. First time peruse Downtown Summerlin all since Hubby wanted take baby nice stroll.  some shopping Sur la Table Hubby chose Public School 702.  must say concept neat.  definitely resembles public school.  menu quite extensive but reading some trustworthy reviews yelp naked wings Jidori spiced chicken waffles.  portion humongous.  Earl also ordered citrus beer took small sip.  think all beer yucky but interesting...it started sour then kind buttery creamy taste.  liked very much though can't drink much since am still nursing.

The ambiance very nice since sat patio beautiful day. First visit Public School. eagerly awaiting opening. Just ordered ice tea Shaved Brussel Sprout Salad light bite. Salad loaded blue cheese super yummy. Highly recommend. back more! first time attempted try place wait 45 minutes. decided just come back next time. finally made Sunday brunch. Overall ok. Service little slow don't know why servers keep bringing food asking if your order. No organization food which table? Bringing food didn't order. Server passed table brought order table next then came back us. review food ordered. Sorry no pictures .
#1 Calamari 4 stars. good greasy
#2 Ahi tuna crunchy tacos 5 stars. favorite nice combinations flavors crunch
#3 Orange juice 5 stars. refreshing mellow tartness citrus. 
#5 Fish chips 1 star fish. always search good fish chips. thought find good but nope. don't much breadings fish since oily. felt eating oil instead fish. 5 stars chips. Crunchy oily perfectly seasoned. 
#6 Kids mac n cheese 5 stars. Kid parents approved. 
#7 Nutella cookie ice cream sandwich 3 stars. Chewy cookies nice crunch outside. some bacon bits add little salty contrast all sweetness. good but nothing dream about. 

This place nice ambiance. menus napkins decors very cool. Coming back?  Maybe. first time everything fantastic! waitress kind helpful knowledgeable menu items. ordered chicken tortilla soup margarita pizza both incredible! loved theme restaurant pizza delicious perfect share another person. outside patio looked nice but way hot sit there. definitely coming back. Great food. wait long. suggest going weird times. Ordered pizza twice. take home. Vanessa great!!!! Service eh but Nutella ice cream sandwich exceptional! Would back just that! Came happy hour wound sitting outside myself while.  First off why misters outside? Everyone came later due bar area being full complaining heat misters would helped.  didn't see any heaters but maybe plan set portable ones winter?  

While took bit waiter kind expecting since only there.  He brought bottle water recommended few beers taste which took being able taste beers before commit pint really great .  He came back fairly quickly again let know he put tastes take food order.  food came good pace tacos first then broccolini but waited waited beer tastes cocktail.  He did come let know bar backed finally beer taste picked still didn't cocktail .  beer cocktail finally came newer people's drinks server said he taking drinks off bill which appreciated.

However let know ready bill then waited waited waited again until another server come serve filling outside area bill.  missing two stars slow service.

The food good back again give another go.  But tip others Friday happy hour very popular early! such mixed feelings place. food good. Truly good. 

I fish chips split cauliflower appetizer watermelon tomato salad. fish cooked really dark but otherwise good. 

It just seems poorly run establishment. example 1. chalkboard listed pineapple cider but it.  Maybe update your board?

2. friend asked regular ketchup because spicy ketchup really spicy. love spicy food but really was. server said she would check but might regular ketchup. What? thimble full thank goodness.

3. friend asked glass ice then asked again. finally came. 

I think really deserve 2.5 stars but Yelp doesn't work way. wanting check place awhile since consistently getting good reviews. husband around dinner time Friday only wait 20 minutes which wasn't bad. 

The first thing notice when walk unbelievably loud is.  loud hostess having difficulty communicating where seat people.  walked little ways started quieter but then seated directly under blaring speaker.  still managed some dinner conversation but did detract experience overall.

We ordered chorizo mac cheese appetizer.  came practically within minute ordering which great timing but also means already prepared waiting order it. even sure mix based fast came. mac cheese alone actually pretty boring.  Adding potato chips gave crunch depth flavor helped.  chorizo pretty standard nothing spectacular.  If managed all four things your fork same time good but great.  

Because appetizer quickly waited 15 minutes entrees appetizer finished.  husband steak salad entree.  supposed white truffle vinaigrette it.  He assured did lightly taste truffle but honestly couldn't taste myself.  Perhaps flavor palette off.  salad overall tasty bunch different things mixed in.  ordered steak med rare came med well but still delicious.

I ordered stout braised ribs entree fantastic.  ribs fell apart soon put your fork them gravy flavorful all served top yukon gold mashed potatoes.  absolutely wonderful.

When bill came over $60 which think wasn't consistent experience there.  those prices head next door Fogo when opens lunch.  may back try recess which happy hour but returning dinner. Great time Brunchism event. Cody Victoria Elizabeth great... super helpful very attentive group. When finished work day last week met Shannon family dinner visit Public School. never heard PS before but when arrived fell love decor ambiance. walking towards PS could see boys waving through glass wall balcony. wonderful welcome new hot spot. food good server best server long time. 

I admit event later evening arrived late joining family dinner PS left early event but experience really good. liked food looking forward going back again soon write more detailed review.

Shannon grandparents weren't impressed was. all agreed tater tots best item had. kids meals extremely small. Great craft beer selection great quinoa salad no hipster buffalo cauliflower great.  I'd again just beer. progressive adventurous beer list exciting twists comfort food PS702 won over within minutes sitting down.  

After sitting booth spacious bar area took several minutes peruse menu.  server Katie incredibly helpful steering choices beer appetizers.  She brought samples no less 6 beers draft specials  I can't even remember last time 6 beers tap interested in.  decor eclectic mix old school school memorabilia  including obsolete encyclopedias composition notebook menus various sports balls  is whimsical charming once evoking nostalgia chuckles.

We couldn't narrow choices ended three apps bacon cheddar tots fiery calamari chorizo mac cheese.  tots won immediate approval DH declaring must own order.  Indeed creamy salty bombs delicious only made better just the right amount of heat sriracha ketchup.  Mac cheese huge chunks chorizo smattering kale just enough pretend healthy.  al dente campanelle smothered emmental cheddar sauce really held sauce sausage well even if tad difficult serve undersized spoon provided.  calamari dusted Japanese togorashi pepper blend served light but potent ginger aioli wasn't revelation but cut above standard would good choice group. Just sure ask extra outstanding aioli.  

After overindulging appetizers split lamb burger.  Melted Brie tomato cranberry jam made just right complement tangy sour umami perfectly cooked lamb patty.  burger belied simple appearance rivaling more complicated offerings other notable Valley restaurants.  accompanying kale shaved Brussels sprout slaw wasn't just throwaway either.  Creamy bitter pungent red onion blue cheese still qualified comfort food while providing much needed veg plate.  

Dessert ginormous version ubiquitously trendy ice cream sandwich but additions Nutella bacon brittle made standout.

Service excellent food served quickly knowledgeable staff.  Katie particular above beyond more once.  highly recommend requesting when visit.

PS702 open late DJ spacious patio Wednesday Saturday industry night Monday.  more typical hours other days.  next visit likely weekend brunch which features limited menu delicious sounding breakfast items fried jidori chicken green chili cornbread waffles eggs Benedict pizza.  high light though just bottomless drink menu which includes mimosas micheladas bloody Mary's which told garnished chicken wing something called beermosa must try combo OJ wheat beer crème de peche lavender.

There nothing didn't love PS702 plan back soon often. Terrible service but good food.

We weren't helped solid ten minutes seated.  party ten everything  ordered came different times. Appetizers salads burgers pizza all came separately. Half done entrees while others still seen appetizers! person even bar order drinks grab plates. desperately needed waters filled no serving plates no condiments no server sight. pretty disappointing unfortunate group work lunch. 

The buffalo cauliflower tots delicious healthy portion. Crunchy breaded outside firm texture inside. buffalo blue cheese sauce served them also good.

The bacon cheese tots ok. potatoes tasted little raw snap usually found tot. 

The watermelon heirloom tomato salad great. Charred watermelon huge slices tomatoes balsamic reduction.

The other people party also complimented food but said would return because poor service. Sorry Public guess school more summer. First thing noticed place awesome environment name. napkins school paper menus composition notebooks all over restaurant feels old high school. really awesome!

Our server very friendly well informed menu. She made lot good suggestions.

I ordered pizza. good great. But overall liked it. 

It's worth shot. think place deserves least 4 stars even tho time don't it. sure why. great experience! always enjoyed Public School 702 food atmosphere service people watching!!! now experienced something new Brunch!!! W.O.W.!!! server Peter Fantastic Point Funny top gave exceptional Service server another extension group!!! recognized Manager Mark server 1st time ever came he remembered party played Beer pong after!!! attention detail service but only reason continue come Public School 702...the Main Reason Bacon Cheddar Tots Jalapeño Ketchup!!! Over all pretty good spot.  outdoor patio overall vibe really good. Food excellent unique.  recommend buffalo cauliflower. wife crushed velvet drink loved it.  reason only gave them 3 stars due beer. good selection but ran two Wheat beers.  tried 3 others. all very hop heavy taste.  first witber which should smooth but strong taste. drank half told server very hoppy asked if anything smoother.  He brought another brand. hoppy but still stronger taste.  comparable brand described him. able finish it. tried more brand but still strong finish.  guess brands ones less harsh.  server didn't seem very knowledgable brands serve. If IPA's your place.  If beer Smithwicks Newcastle Leinenkugel Stella smoother domestics would recommend going beer.  Great vibe though. back if friends pick place. Don't see choosing DTS spot. fun themed environment decent inventive food. don't want late night unless raucous 20something into loud music. If sophisticated adult lunch early dinner. during recess happy hour some time kill decided try few appetizers settled Ahi tuna tacos $7 4 small garlic truffle fries $4 margarita pizza $7 since diet coke no free refills decided iced tea yes free refills she hot green tea. food really tasty flavorful ended having nice meal really fair prices !! best meals long time. surprised discover open 11 Sunday turns brunch starting 10 bottomless ish mimosas micheladas Bloody Marys other choices already forget. 

He smothered burrito chef's stuffed blackberry lemonade french toast. burrito delicious perfect blend flavors french toast...you lemon curd. Even mimosas weren't half assed splash blood orange. prices way more reasonable. back. Very nice atmosphere feels almost you're different city when you're here. chorizo mac cheese delicious but certainly share appetizer. decent selection beer but wouldn't come just that. best part chewy Nutella ice cream cookie dessert got. However big may think double size your mind because huge. shared between four didn't finish it. cookie really very yummy chewy moist perfect amount Nutella both sides. vanilla bean ice cream between flavorful looked but all all delicious. 
The only con drinks including beers took pretty long time get. all ordered drinks all took noticeably long time table. Other really any complaints. server very friendly knowledgable. several times always leave pleased. But personally love Brunch mimosa special! brunch pizza delicious! patio sets apart other places DTS when weather permits. kids mac cheese Divine. Always great friendly service too. Everything tastes real fresh. Looking forward brunch soon. Completely pleasantly surprised food good noise level bad oldster me. Pretty cool place hang out.  Descent food atmosphere crowd heart summerlin. Just name restaurant everything public school themed! decor flooring ceiling bar area menus napkins etc. all school related. pretty neat concept!

Everything party ordered delicious! company meeting which vendor said they'd cover bill. she nice enough order pretty much half menu! Score!!! = The appetizers good tasty! Buffalo Cauliflower then Speck Eggs Chorizo Mac Cheese then Bacon Cheddar Tots Ahi Tacos... full trying everything couldn't even eat entrée! must say though Ahi Tacos bland which very bummed since Ahi Poke fav. Nonetheless everything else good.

I then straight dessert ordered Nutella Cookie Sandwich also Lemon Meringue Pie jar. lemon meringue way sour but enjoyed Nutella cookie very much!

I also ordered Guavalajara cocktail delicious.

I'd definitely come back here! Okay start bad first kitchen slow little particles floating around water some sides glass which see. server very kind. She seemed she running around beginning she table breath. just wanted tell take easy lol. ordered Bloody Mary half way through meal although garnished chicken wing couldn't finish because spicy salty etc. would say try drink more drink spicy sauce hickey wing. just spicy point only sipped maybe 25% drink 4 sipping it . But now onto good stuff! food amazing. calamari chorizo Mac cheese appetizer didn't picture when first came due fact excited hungry. calamari delicious good size appetizer 5 people. chorizo Mac cheese the shit ! Never tasted any Mac cheese quite even come potato chips top give 'em little crunch. Next entree fish chips say least good. didn't right flavor looking but mind first time EVER ordering fish chips those fish chips love tartar sauce place should to. Next came dessert since waited while food gave complimentary dessert which Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich lemon merengue. desserts outstanding! Just keep mind lemon merengue packs little punch but delicious. rated place 4 stars because food awesome even though kitchen slow management actually showed cared dining experience. few things need fixed little particles water maybe tone all spices down Bloody Mary well. But other no complaints because food absolutely delicious  right?! Definitely spot check second floor pretty cool view. came Sunday evening dinner. seated right away awesome patio. great selection beers love 'school' theme! food amazing lot interesting options. bison burger quinoa salad bangers mash ice cream sandwich bacon dessert. waiter Zo especially helpful offered lot advice would like. He definitely sold dessert well worth it. can't wait come back!! 20 visits Public School say favorite restaurants. I'd say only once disappointed something ordered. atmosphere casual but you'd feel comfortable date wear casual day shopping wear. theme inside grade school stuff gym floor panels globes math flash cards. love community style high top tables bar area USB ports found underneath bar *hint bar area open seating if wait seated . great beer selection including rotating tap list. 

Let's talk food now tops picks order almost every time Buffalo Cauliflower appetizer amazing! Its fried tossed buffalo sauce served blue cheese sauce.

The food eclectic hard dig through menu. would nice if few simpler items menu just enjoying some food while drinking your beer. look things Google figure some cases. said bison burger wasn't bad but way expensive little patty get. them before much bigger cheaper.

The waitress great first but then she disappeared until done. don't remember coming back once during meal itself. Came two girlfriends check loved it! atmosphere really cool loved fact games outside gave something rather just stand around bar.  only drinks but peeked menu definitely back try out.  jungle juice which really good both beers which great! bartender very helpful giving suggestions samples. Great atmosphere views but food menu nothing talk about. Ordered margarita pizza let's just say take Cali pizza kitchen over it. Stick cocktails. food very good except frito pie pizza which didn't even remotely resemble frito pie all but atmosphere awful. music loud could hardly carry conversation yell orders waiter couldn't hear anything he said specials. tables incredibly close together uncomfortable. grown ups table next throwing coins each other nobody told them knock off besides another table customers glares receiving end some those coins. waiter great refilling waters beginning but didn't pay much attention he should during meal. Cool decor though. maybe visit lunch would better. Stay away Friday night. service very good very nice open atmosphere.   liked tge simplicity menu we're happy choices.  lamb burger medium fantastic watermelon heirloom tomato salad.  Fantastic! First time best service Christian Escobar . He made drink want even menu . Great food come back again coz best service Tried place because having Father's Day special Brunch.  Ordered DEAN'S LIST BREAKFAST $14.  worth it. plate looked pretty empty Denny's gives more food. eggs cold bacon mostly fat. Since boyfriends food EGGS BENEDICT PIZZA $13 free he also ordered beer. bill plus tip $30.  $30 looks child's plate 1 beer. opinion many better options would gotten better food better price. chairs Oh god most uncomfortable chairs ever sat in!!
I should also note while waiting lot other food being served looked really good. just opinion 1 plate price. work retirement party no air! 105 degrees outside cooler inside. Also food disgusting. shared mac cheese naked wings. stomach messed afterwards. only ate two bites.
Do here! Any restaurant handle huge group 14 crazy people haven't seen each other three years all talking over each other sharing stories while waitress taking orders awesome book.  just Public School 702 did.  did great job managing table requests food complaint my friend upset he only 4 shrimp shrimp grits while around 10 .

I realllllllllly food here.  Brussels sprouts farro scallop salad flavorful light.  huge portion boot.  shrimp grits nice grill cutting board good mix meat cheese.  liked all apps except calamari which just so so. 

I tried three cocktails menu none them fantastic me.  little disappointed drink menu but full bar nice selection craft beers well it.

The space itself such cute theme napkins look lined paper menus look composition books library wall inside restaurant.  ample seating large patio even beer pong Jenga socializing.  Great spot groups happy hour date. Good food atmosphere.  Service great. Bar behind.  waiter made it. short ribs buffalo burger amazing Located north end Downtown Summerlin actually did even know location until friend pointed out. three times amazing happy hour. deep fried cauliflower best. also ordered Ahi tacos mushroom pizza sliders. also great craft beers. If doing happy hour no later then 430pm best seats. amazing service! Peter server great. Great service personality made stay exceptional. Definitely come back .... only if Peter here. restaurant most unique themes ever seen school. fun unique place huge great parties. all atmosphere even menus composition notebooks. nice menu much selection variety price pricier side. came 10 friends Saturday brunch bottomless mimosa special $10. ordered eggs grits top dish very good but grits meh. tasted kind funny didn't finish it. friend's dishes seemed appetizing though. servers very kind attentive made sure refills. Overall would give theme originality atmosphere 5 stars but food selection 3 stars. Great atmosphere vibe! Good ok nothing spectacular did takes 30 minutes drink...that ordered two different waiters... still need work some crinks Food excellent. calamari salmon fig prosciutto pizza. Everything perfectly cooked tasted great. 

Service bit slow nothing major just seemed bit long items order. 

Only major downside noise. music loud hard hear person next you. If lower more background place would 5 5. 

I'll definitely back noise level didn't offset great food friendly staff. sat bar happy hour. Service fine no issues place deceivingly busy inside outside looked wasn't even open . Liked school type decor down lined college ruled 'paper' bar napkins. Nice touch. Thought would've cool gym themed locker rooms bathrooms complete moldy gym towels hamper...maybe would taking far?

We drink prices bad happy hour flat bread hummus baba ganoush. Both awesome. overall menu very gastropub style back some point try some food. Would also check outdoor seating deck shaded afternoon. Wise planing very wise. Meh. really want place. Beautiful interior. Staff really tries good service. felt still knowing ropes. Food fig prosciutto pizza expected figs guessing fig sauce. Arugula overkill overtook prosciutto. Chopped salad needs contrast. all fatty texture crunch. saying it.. Bland. Charcuterie plate all bread. 2 meats 5 slices each. Deviled eggs nothing new just add very crispy bacon stabbed top. only redeeming thing would back drink Player's cut. Just add more luxardo cherries. Cool spot. Great food pretty impressive beer selection. Lots seating including outdoor options when 100+ degrees. define y back. some things experienced 10 some two... really two but its dramatc right! Lol. Anyway Calamari world oh tender. first attempt entre miss me. ordered short ribs fully expecting savory childhood flavors grew eating but... day age add special ingredients theres risk throwing off your tastebuds. Thats happened me.  Horseradish? would thunk? dont.. Its fail but might it. replaced Shrimp n Grits. First bite epic win subsequent bites found  shrimp over cooked sauce fell little flat. tasty enough but perfect. partner Quinoa Salad epic HIT! She thoroughly satisfied. finished banana pudding which call cho mommas banana puddin.. Cuz aint lol. light airy sweet. Its Grey ish hue threw off. wasnt pretty could used more cookie.  Oh Public School humble opinion lose dark chocolate shavings throughout pudding its overpowering. Please thank you. Lastly cookie cuz gluttons.... amazing. ice cream rich nor decadent. cookie good partner liked nutella but said carmelized bacon epic miss. advice PBS 702... Toasted coconut... Jus sayin.  Thanks cool date night! But room grow! really impressed upon initial arrival. Real contemporary feel art deco design. 
We ordered food. bacon tater tots good well buffalo cauliflower. Next came margherita pizza. waitress setting table noticed bug crawling it. pointed right away. She looked visibly shaken said loud oh no ! She immediately took pizza back kitchen. 
Not really feeling eating anything point just asked bill. only two appetizers.
Next she came back manager proceeded blame bug fact keep doors open all night. don't care if cooking middle jungle food should bugs it. 
Although plan pay bill would nice offered offset bill offer complimentary dessert something. manager acted if trying take shot something. just feel situation could handled differently. 
Sadly most likely never back there. really liked vibe.
I would only given place star however waitress Julianne sweetheart. place really nice all food choices menu look good. staff friendly good recommendations. enjoyed crispy chicken sandwich. very filling even though didn't seem big enough two probably was.

Gotta try really enjoyed visit there. food really different very enjoyable. tend frequent places because bar place superb!  bartender name Ryan really stuck out. She super friendly helpful drink suggestions. definitely back see her. First off location convenient.  decor theme unique just fun. waitress informative friendly made great recommendations. 
Now food part..... food amazing!!! cheese meat tray. generally pretty picky! ate everything tray loved it. chicken waffles unique spin but absolutely delicious. ahi tuna tacos another tasty treat.  Other reviews mentioned $5 drinks. $10 near bottomless drinks 4 each!!! Food drinks good but service beyond slow especially bar. You're new business step build your clientele! 

Ugh hate bad service!

I can't even count many times bartenders made eye contact then just walked right proceeded servers drinks polish glasses. No bang your buck here. happy hour recess time decent. reviewed lunch dinner menu while waited food. much price difference happy hour! $1 difference. just bar food. crushed velvet. version Moscow mule blueberry blackberry flavor. Parmesan truffle frites speck eggs crispy naked wings crispy ahi tuna tacos. thing worth we're truffle fries ahi tuna tacos. food decent. tell trying bring different flavor style menu. wings tasted fried chicken side note don't ranch. worth try but honestly would back. Conner Mandy hospitable. Cocktails lunch best based suggestions. Come down some food drink!! ate brunch enjoyed it. brunch menu limited but ordered roasted veggie item full flavor. 'basically bottomless' menu item mimosas beermosas bloody marys. basically bottomless four drinks menu. good deal but took way long drinks. would recommend ordering two time. If weather nice sit outside great atmosphere! concept restaurant really cool takes back grade school years sure.  food great entire menu craveable.  chefs lot technical skill ordered salmon which placed top brussel sprouts instead them which great because then salmon didn't absorb flavoring vegetables kept its integrity.  highly recommend tots chicken waffle.  brunch menu fantastic wish offered more brunch menu regular menu.  *only* thing don't love regular fries just nothing really exciting them last time them overcooked hard instead crispy. Im giving institution star because unfortunately cant give anything below.  first time place.  came two friends mine all first timers Vegas veterans well versed quality service food town many years.  came Saturday brunch sat bar experienced intermittent zero service.  staff seemed didnt care all.  ordered breakfast burritto without cheese told since premade couldnt customize all.  When food came tasted overbaked dry sauceless tasteless top heavy seemed deep fried.  Furthermore ordered bottomless drinks mimosa average once every 25 minutes average.  truly unacceptable Las Vegas standard would expect more institution especially since its among several fine restaurants Downtown Summerlin.  hope management reviews carefully takes constructively because really should step game until then would unlikely come again recommend family friends.  management did take entrees off bill which most appreciated. Noticed few restaurants LA but didn't enough time try. happy when opened Vegas. Great location vary spacious area. decor blast past vibe fused school vibe. pair metal strap roller skates really brought back some memories. Came Saturday eleven a.m. place twenty people.  hour later place packed. food. Started spicy calamari. calamari cooked perfectly. However because bay seasoning amount salt overpowering. Ordered Huntsman burger extra bacon. Loved flavor balsamic caramelized onions. downside burger sat burger juice bottom bun soggy. fries over cooked but enjoyed crunch. Ended lunch Nutella chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich. Very sweet huge portion. could only eat half but enjoyed dessert. Ambience service point. Food great. give place second try sure wasn't just ordered. really selection beers served Tenaya Creek beer. best beers Vegas. imagine would great place reunion just party. lunch last Friday 4 22 16 hearing coworkers race place.  super excited.  ordered shorty bowl iced tea friend fish chips lemonade.   First greeted waiter trainee.  drinks lemonade looked water.  Tasted water hint lemon.   ordered.  told shorty bowl best thing menu.  Great!  
Food arrived excited!  couldn't even stomach it.  grit throughout every layer bowl if maybe arugula wasn't washed?  disgusting.  waited waiter come but place filling lunch crowd.  Crickets for anyway .
 friend liked taste fish chips but batter super thick.  She literally took fish showed thick shell cooked beer batter.  
Finally trainee re appears takes dishes.  Mine hardly touched didn't even question if everything ok something wrong.   expected whole different level food service public school...certainly didn't live I'd heard
Giving 2 stars just wanting place versus 1 gritty sand filled dish. great place hang delicious apps entrees fun ambiance watermelon mojitos amazingly good! Hhhhhhoooorible! Walked out! First all called address RECEPTIONIST HUFFED PUFFED  because she didn't know zip code street address. wait 45 min long line people. thought ok status quo new restaurant BUT most employees temporary transplants other public school restaurants. manage crush velvet bourbon some sort bar bar manager bar inhabited couch potatoes nursing draft beers. noticed several group people leave line am now close enough see empty booths bar section empty tables empty communal tables large enough seat party 5 2 . walk menu management gal podium asked if could sit communal tables told need reservation seated. think myself NEED RESERVATION SIT BAR COMMUNAL TABLE? Why? quickly scan dining room other side serval tables besides booths tables bar EMPTY!i say menu management gal need reservation sit bar? Since when? Other Public school restaurants allow walk sit down communal tables. Doesn't defeat concept COMMUNAL? best part when gal just call charge asked if I'd sit side...... ....In 110 degree heat?  Really? Now why would she offer outside when several available tables EVERY SECTION HUGE  restaurant. If new restaurant trying create allure something velvet rope days Studio 54 missing mark! located brand new mall many trendy restaurants. People easily elsewhere will......and did.  GRADE FAIL! came  Public School 702 Wednesday night cousin. just finished watching movie decided check out. restaurant easy find host front friendly. outdoor indoor seating. wanted sit outside but host informed would wait opted sit inside avoid wait check restaurant's decor.

Being high school teacher absolutely adored restaurant's decor. decorated school memoriabilia including trophies books etc. also awesome solar system model hanging ceiling other school themed canvases wall.The menus resembled composition notebooks which cute touch well. restaurant stayed true its public school theme.

As far food super hungry decided order small. asked server recommendations she able give recommendations each category which nice. However being eat pork limited options could entree section. Almost every dish bacon if love bacon your place! menu also seems cater older crowd seemed kid friendly. did see if kid's menu but assuming don't since most people restaurant 21+.

We ended ordering buffalo cauliflower along Irish stout braised  ribs. buffalo cauliflower actually pretty great. am fan cauliflower but perfectly breaded tasted just buffalo wing. served horseradish buffalo sauce. okay buffalo sauce but absolutely hated horseradish sauce. figured would least option ranch but server said did serve ranch but could offer aioli which politely declined. ranch type girl thought weird buffalo sauce flavored food without it. Regardless ranch though buffalo cauliflower definitely try. Irish stout braised ribs also delicious. runner food said best entree menu she right! meat boneless tender. paired perfectly mashed potatoes served under it. would definitely recommend ordering dish!

The atmosphere restaurant itself calm seems sort lounge. server pleasant but took while bringing check asked it. She stood another table talking almost 5 minutes irritating wait when asked before that. Once check saw meal came $30 two dishes which bad guess. only issues place having ranch but also server giving check late. Other those two issues place nice try tasty food! giving 3 stars because although good great place try don't know if come back again choice. can't update tap list online! food combinations think cook Dr. Frankinstein! back basics unique flavor combinations horrible! while since given restaurant five stars.  place definitely worth coming back over over again.  decided hit happy hour.  $5 apps well drinks. cannot that.  everything wings Margarita flat bread sliders fried cauliflower Ahi tacos.  Nothing left behind. devoured all.  fan cauliflower fact hated since kid.  friend ordered without knowing.  When came grabbed again without knowing damn amazing!   Once just cannot stop.  definitely made want home it.   great tasted.  wings awesome well.  definitely new favorite spot. Can't wait back. Service terrible but food good enough come back to. 
Huge beer selection. 
I shared bison burger crispy chicken sandwich both good. 
I loved buffalo cauliflower starter. Love place! Ahi tacos buffalo cauliflower favorite!! Gets pretty busy dinner suggest going early! Pizzas huge.. Even kids pizzas! generally meet friend lunch once month month PS 702 Downtown Summerlin.  restaurant second floor dining arroyo section.  surprised large both interior outdoor patio were.  plenty room outside nice afternoon table shade.  theming around school gimmick but OK.   your brand stand when food similar any number places.

I fried chicken sandwich fries iced tea.  Service quick friendly.  sandwich good atmosphere very enjoyable.  

Iced tea refills brought without asking pleasant lunch.  Public School 702 A OK. took all good things off menu staff dwindled down started off great but fizz worn off team great experience all staff!  attended every needs including specific dietary restrictions. staff kind enough help celebrate birthday allowed team bring cake sing happy birthday!  Everyone above beyond team am forever grateful. can't wait back visit friendly staff when back Vegas. wear your sunglasses inside cool here. guess just guy.

Food nothing excited about. Ordered Thyme Time drink which very good but $12 six chicken wings? Chicken sandwich tacos just okay. $60 hungry hour. 

Come atmosphere drinks don't forget your shades bro. great pick family.  Tater tots great!  shrimp grits much different version anticipated. ..but well worth it! Wife chocken tortilla soup roasted beet salad..that well...just nothing special..but ok. Service great..definitely back! aren't many spots Vegas give 5 stars but every time come great experience. 

Food all food incredible really great selection satisfy anyone everyone. highly suggest Buffalo Cauliflower...unreal! also some awesome deals during Happy Hour M F 330 630. 

Environment very cute theme restaurant dimly lit inviting. great patio summer months fun games
and things. Nice spot bring group!

Service waitstaff always great. server Mandi sweet very knowledgeable menu offering personal favorites suggestions. She clearly took great deal pride work invited dine again which definitely will! 5 stars well deserved. Confirmed gave another try anything special bit over priced.  Staff polite friendly helpful apparently fans broken. Disappointing because patio beautiful.  great example potential being squandered. brunch some friends! Located downtown summerlin patio overlooking mall good day good weather beautiful spot brunch lunch dinner. food unfortunately alright me! friends thought same food. can't really pinpoint flavors all it... just kinda tasted bland. Which hate saying! w Mac cheese margarita pepperoni pizza steak tacos. price paid wish could gotten more plates. Decided eat friends heard much drinks recess menu now am educated favorite part school. great place visit just enjoy company friends alcohol great food. drinking beer getting ready nights festivities. 

The service stellar since sat bar no wait time party but two party we're already drinks table when walked in. Wow friends for! tele's play Knights game only sport currently am following good winning too! great time getting ready night great beer hockey! girlfriend hit place happy hour Wednesday. first impression cool place decorated highschool motif all little details incredible. craft beer menu excellent although only few beers available happy hour prices cocktails very reasonably priced but also available happy hour prices. food menu most unique seen chorizo mac n cheese off chain! Also service excellent Tyler Mark kind servers usually only much more expensive establishments. definitely back. Came couple days ago. know guys waiting review. 
This place isn't tooo shabby nice hipster type place. But food just mediocre say least. gonna hop hype train everyone else going give guys real review. Food just ehh know tell your neighbors keep down. You're just keep down the food ehhhhhh know mean rather Bjs lazy dog anywhere dts! visited Tuesday night sat bar take advantage Public School's awesome happy hour.

The good 1 service wonderful 2 decor very cute even if little heavy handed. love good theme when business really commits 3 those PB J sliders money 4 huge beer selection.

The bad 1 deviled eggs kale Caesar no bueno. eggs bland salad really sweet. Unexpected Caesar good way 2 bar area gets really loud conversation challenge.

The final word really unique spot Downtown Summerlin. worth visit case second visit. Tuesday night bar sausage fest. Saturday night place must single lady's wet dream. Public School always A Ok book.  great place visit larger groups 8+ for dinner quick casual appetizer time because area.  reviewing off those experiences...

Public School service Servers consistently good through all visits.  during busier times kitchen still does pretty good job getting entrees table quickly.  bar long isn't rotation bartenders you're taken care pretty well.

Public School cuisine tried Thai Noodle Shrimp Salad BLT Steak Salad both average ordering again.  However pretty good success dishes when trying healthy af. ie. PB J Burger which uniquely tasty prepped perfectly.  Margherita pizza always good me.  favorite appetizers crispy buffalo cauliflower Parmesan Truffle fries.

Public School ambiance Gastropub decor provides very cool casual dining experience.  dig solar system model hangs ceiling.  Shuffleboard giant Jenga blocks good time if you're hanging bit.  Where Public School gets A+ ability seat large parties big tables booths main dining area patio.

The craft beer selection decent pair some dishes meant tasty healthy think greasy fun you're going A ok.  little pricey but good place if want grab some quick appetizers need place accommodate big party short notice.  Enjoy yourself...= Surprisingly good food attentive staff works team common again really good food.  beer selection solid seating great. Also charging stations booths.  Study hall pizza beer killer spot drinking studying.  pizza sleeper well Mezze appetizers.  Mmmmm. place gets Top rated stars because service everyone absolutely phenomenal ! Everyone super nice great customer service. WORST service ever Jessica!!!! 

Horrible server! Took 10 minutes greet another 5 minutes water. Did write down order which fine if good server but okay if can't remember order. She took another 10 minutes actually input order into POS. know since table next POS she confirm wanted burger she entered system. delayed effort resulted forgetting all ordering appetizer. 

I worked restaurant before understand when gets busy when mistakes happen etc .. but then Jessica audacity lie forgetting appetizer instead blamed person ran food taking app wrong table then later blamed kitchen problem. Said kitchen having bad day. More SHE having bad day. would much better just admit making mistake then apologize comp appetizer.  

The two stars because manager came check apologize error. She seemed genuinely apologetic kind. 

Jessica meanwhile dropped off check then disappeared. asked box take leftovers home but she never came back. flag down another person box! Guess Jessica figured she wasn't getting tip no longer mattered her! Customer service best Public School 702! foodie partner crime aka husband sat bar least 5 times.  first few trips just ok beer selection always fantastic but food bit average side. Regardless always hard score spot bar.  bartenders always friendly authentic super passionate beer connoisseurs my man sniff faker .  Tonight decided try salmon which bartender Conner recommended.  usually policy never ordering salmon cuz routinely sucks.  delight TOTALLY awesome! super cool detail discovered usb chargers tables under bar if you're run juice every night around 8 o'clock you're saved.  seems 702 PS growing nicely paying attention teacher's corrections worst service ever ! ask 4 different workers just salt shaker . waitress looked extremely bothered every time asked anything especially when asked split checks she even laughed when asked. She never came check ask drink refills multiple times before ever received drinks she blamed bar saying extremely busy when no bar. bottomless drinks aren't bottomless only allowed 4. Hated . never return. late Wednesday night some friends Ryan bartender he amazing! Made excellent drinks very attentive. also ordered some food partaking few shots. ordered deviled eggs pepperoni pizza fig pizza. food okay nothing special but did job. back very soon maybe eat but definitely drink. whole place looked amazing decorated very cool. decided quick brunch mothers birthday. Everything great beginning. ordered bangers mash which good. sausages okay felt gravy should lil thicker. chicken sandwich great. no complaints that. 
Even pizza pretty good but nothing any different tried before. 

The only thing disappointing customer service. why giving 1 star. would gave place higher review but told hostess front mothers birthday wanted lil something her. She said cake candle she let server know. 
So waiting waiting cake. server comes grabs check anticipating cake surprise mom. 15 min later damn does really take long give back card. thinking maybe they're going give cake when she returns card. But noooo server comes back gives back card tells nice day. left. 
So upset!! really wanted surprise mom. Never again coming back here. 

Not trained employees don't give crap. Made reservation lunch advised two different people.  best advice when arrived group front wait. didn't. Upon looking menu online worried didn't show prices. usually means going expensive. 

The menus took back school days brunch menu test scantron regular menu composition book. Being lunch wasn't feeling breakfast much Bison BBQ burger. beginning servers attentive but closer end meal stopped coming much waited while bill.

My burger tasty.  However didn't taste any BBQ sauce which rather disappointed with. cheese ratio astounding! Usually feel restaurants skimp cheese but covered whole burger. also came side fries sriracha ketchup.  fries ok although can't eat spicy ketchup addicting! 

The atmosphere restaurant nice. played reggae tunes which made feel home Hawaii.  decor eccelectic kept eyes wandering. 

I great experience would love come back try other foods beers.  hear great happy hour. food good. atmosphere vibrant crowded. lot younger people age 21 30. Reminded club type place meet greet grab grub between. 

A little loud hard relax stressful day work. But if kind atmosphere want pound down couple drinks meet some random strangers strike conversation perfect place you!

I'll back try again update review. only time drink appetizer next time sit down dinner some friends. Huntsman burger bacon very impressed. Super flavorful very tasty. Fries above average well. don't offer carry ranch dressing which odd...every school America serves ranch. very accommodating subbing items wife special food needs well. definitely back. Customer service priority restaurant.  menu extremely cool but good luck getting eat without hour wait.  came Sunday night wait hour place empty!  Seriously!  can't even imagine Friday Saturday would like. drinks few friends being way wasn't really worth it.
As soon walk see someone standing door whom going guess host... but doesn't look nor act definitely seated ourselves.
For drinks apple jack guava something then asked server more drink doesn't taste alcohol but plenty it.. all three those drinks disgusting. ginger apple Jack way strong tequila guava drink overpowered any other flavor it. Also side note feel bartender new because when watching drinks she measured literally eveeything.. still tasted bad.
So stars received food! calamari shrimp grits mushroom pizza bison burger. calamari delicious! nice crunch perfect amount seasoning ginger aoili paired really good it. also shrimp grits. don't really grits picked off few bites shrimp tasty. really liked flavor sauce surrounding it.  also ordered bison burger. never having bison before felt burger more plain jane. much better tasting burgers less money. did come fries though. Lastly mushroom pizza very good choice. never wrong mushroom pizza truffle oil. Absolutely delicious. only thing wrong friend expressed she didn't want any chili flakes server insisted none yet literally see flakes chili pizza. Even she pointed server could care less kitchen's mistake. 
After all tried order dessert but kitchen closed. Apparently ordered pizza 40 minutes kitchen closed but good did if server didn't even tell when last call was??? thought dumb. mostly reason 2 stars. able order cookies milk which didn't fulfill anyone's tastebuds..
Overall wouldn't back. Even if shopping downtown summerlin far better bars places eat Downtown summerlin closeby. place yesterday such great place hangout friends. All food tried delicious. Everyone worked really friendly manger Tommy super great customer service love place definitely place regularly hang friends. would definitely recommend place anyone. pretty underwhelming first visit. Again usually don't write review 1 visit.. but pretty unhappy when left. 

It started arriving 10 pm being told menu until 1 am. so.. late night menu started 10 pm appearantly. pretty mediocre selection food point but figured drove all way would give try. given full menu. But here's all went.. 

We ordered drinks found seats bar. Sat front bartender cleaned well literally 15 minutes without even looking up. literally foot face. Nothin. friend says time close? She says different every day she back cleaning. other buddy says but still order food right? She says nothing hands late night menus full menu continues cleaning. Without any other explanation. waited patiently she polished grate well wiped down then walked away. bewildering. 

My buddy ask another bartender passing if could order. bartender said well time it? LOL! said i's 1030.. he said ooooh let check... he says. 

He gave thumbs other end bar but did return take order. when he came end bar again 5 minutes later pour draft beer buddy just started ordering loud. haha.. mean no intention being rude.. but trying way hard order no one interested serving us. all all worked eat. Very hungry. 3 bartenders literally 9 people bar.. only ones trying eat just could service. 

So now watching original female bartender cleaning bar well front us. She grabs glass water bottle.. drinks then grabs bottle appeared lemon juice bar well all watched she poured lemon juice into water bottle. She did touching mouth lemon juice bottle mouth bottle she just drank then put juice bottle back well. no way squeemish though  just kind gross mention just wrong. 

So far wtf. 

So food.. finally chance order told only late night menu available.. all  time..we made some decisions informed couldn't order them. explanation when dropping menus would helpful. 

So ordered Calamari flavor ok crispy ALL despite being fried.. mean literally soggy. Naked wings all flats no drums which weird but crispy good.. deviled eggs.. good.. but presentation those eggs prepared set few minutes because yolks looking fresh also ordered truffle fries. fries SUCKED. Seriously. Luke warm soggy served preserved lemon aioli? didn't understand liked aioli but fries that's just .. did eaten yet taken away bartender without question whether done if some reason over 75% unfinished. there's that.

Still very hungry decided FIG Prosciutto Pizza Taleggio Mushroom pizza. even going into becuase both very sloppy presentation just mediocre flavor overall. Honestly. ate most Fig Prosciutto less half Mushroom Taleggio. 

What say he pizzas female food runner brought food over literally shoved drink side trying move dirty plates previous course way then quite obviously tossed both pizza plates onto bar walked away. spun around like.. wtf? buddies both just laughed because just over point. She looked miserable taking us! haha.. laughable retrospect but mean really?! She then walked end bar service well started chewing finger nails. No Joke. 

Ok listen.. am trying just angry diner this.. but say again absolutely no reason medocire food service town Las Vegas. many choices where people actually want right thing serve quality product.

This experience fail all easy going foodie kind people. 

I no intention back PUBLIC SCHOOL 702 soley based service. would liked try regular menu but experience just bust me. 

Sorry Happy Eating though! Haley waitress awesome!!
Bartenders really slow but she made stellar customer service.

A group new friends joined boyfriend some drinks ended staying entire happy hour. Great drinks awesome happy hour prices food bevs fun menu.

Cauliflower buffalo bites phenomenal hummus mouth watering. back tomorrow  !! Delicious! Loved buffalo cauliflower hot mess sandwich! fish chips last time they're all time favorite dish. Haven't anything bad yet! Quinoa salad also yummm! Servers also very helpful when turn between options. Beer selection adventurous. restaurant few times last night experience horrible! start two host persons door girl boy 11 21 2015 around 6 30PM . entered stand behind them 2 minutes because seem having own conversations! valued customer restaurant should disturb little private conversations?? NO!!! finally girl acknowledged standing behind them she said wait 25 minutes! guess what?? could see where standing many seats available bar where fully serve all menu items!!! she didn't even bother suggest that!!! Wow!! Felt she think don't want busy !!!  since know sit bar sat. ordered two appetizers two entrees two cocktails usual! pasta cold but sent back warm up. During time someone took away all utensils assuming am done eating therefore wait another few minutes new utensils again! wish didn't put much BBQ sauce bison burger! Very disappointed really!!! Public 702 located downtown Summerlin over Crave. inside intelligently designed old retro school items such lunch boxes pom poms megaphones display cases old bleachers nailed wall. menu looks black white speckled composition book napkins lined notebook paper. Very smart marketing. 
Food quite good each item ordered said delicious. Appetizers buffalo cauliflower Mac cheese bacon cheese tater tots. Food ordered Huntsburger brown bag fries chopped salad roasted poblano stuffed veggies quinoa fried chicken waffles. 
So why 3 stars? server!! dinner took 3 hours. repeatedly saw server hallway eating talking other servers. She took 15 minutes come over seated another 15 come back drinks she disappeared while waited place food orders once other servers delivered food then once checked see if needed anything husband no utensils. When finished kept waving down other servers server check. server never arrived. Another server finally brought check. table time sit down leaving almost 3 hours. 
Doubt I'd way back try other restaurants area. great place enjoy quality brew unique greasy bits compliment beer.  little pricey but quality it.  Happy Hour 4 7pm Monday Friday.  arrived 7 30pm Tuesday Night very slow which am complaining about.  Service quick thoughtful.  restaurant may empty but very clean.  grabbed Vegas Golden Knights Schedule Toothpick way Movie which just short walk away. FUNNNNN! such fun restaurant check out! Everything school themed. solar system hanging ceiling menu composition book even takeout bag says homework! xD Super cool.
They wide selection beer. tried Blueberry sour beer LOVED IT. two row. If sour beer please try it!

For food chicken waffle shirmp grits tuna poke!
All super good. twice now. Fun place hang friends... Good food but service VERY slow both visits. If improve service would give them 5 stars. Food good..decor cool ..service .. good. Took 30 minutes beer 4pm afternoon. Can't even image if busy. Wanted love place but just couldn't based service only. Great food!!!!! only thing don't filter water. hard reverse osmosis don't bring own water? Hopefully... Wonderful lunch experience. cheese board buffalo cauliflower. Margherita  pizza fantastic. Service prompt. Would recommend friends. View amazing outside deck. Service definitely declined visit #2. Food still awesome!!! Can't wait service return normal.... Great food great service highly recommended. brunch try French toast won't disappointed Atmosphere very fun food delicious! almost bottomless mimosas 4 glasses even better! came last week happy hour best town!! kidding every app ahi tuna margarita pizza speck eggs hummus chorizo mac cheese fav! All apps beers great! Great prices food service. sat outside patio really nice. Can't it!! Great atmosphere fantastic food. Server Vanessa only knowledgeable fun attentive but super cute well.  definitely back! Upon first visit Public School impressed. service great atmosphere great but food fell flat. 

I decided give place another shot few great suggestions friends. most recent visit Public School started great beer appetizer then entree. order bacon cheddar tots entree ordered delicious crispy chicken sandwich. know chicken sandwich sounds pretty basic but wasn't just ordinary chicken sandwich. special sauce pickles kale mix between sweet salty. If back would probably order yummy sandwich again because yum!

I love decor school related theme. genius someone create restaurant related school. relatable depending time your visit menu change. If visit during brunch then may test menu. If visit during happy hour dinner then cute composition book.

The also offer great outdoor seating offers amazing view local shoppers beautiful sky. favorite visit night looking stars while enjoy beer. 

This great spot intimate date your significant other fun place catch friends. liked PS 702 most part. came lunch which worked small wait if came 12. seated right away commented big place was. menus napkins definitely fit theme good job details. Now goodies...

I couldn't decide appetizer wanted try. ended picking Mac cheese over cauliflower even though hubby said could both. However being 9 months pregnant only take few bites feel full. already decided before would Fig Prosciutto pizza. other half decided bangers mash. food came fairly quickly luckily because lil hungry. fig prosciutto pizza good but bit spicy preggo. didn't know bit spice factor wouldn't ordered otherwise. good but wish more fig taste. couldn't see any fig bits really taste lil disappointing. didn't try bangers...only mash. know carbs! good sized portion lunch price definitely well worth it. gone time done eating assumed delicious husband really hungry. Mac cheese really liked kale it. ladies next kept eyeing Mac cheese told them next time. big fan chorizo but  your eating partner for!

Overall liked place atmosphere. wouldn't afraid bringing kids because fairly noisy other people wouldn't notice if your kid talking loudly. Service great beginning end server no where found. Granted lunch rush just prepared bit wait if during rush. Place wasn't busy able add +1 party no problem. 5 orders 2 came incorrect. spouses dinner came correct 10 minutes later mine...well 20 minutes later finally came correct. Thank goodness ordered side order fries $6 would starved death waiting order. First most likely last time establishment. Oh drink refills don't even there. Yes comped dinner but since all party eaten already cares...comps don't equal explanations poor service all around Great time. Came three friends happy hour. 
Menu wonderful server Tyler amazing. return ask sit Tyler's section. Came mimosa brunch disappointed! $10 mimosas  food delicious chicken sausage grits! Connor initial server amazing! He kept drinks coming! Visited place yesterday first time wasn't shabby. seated right away. server knowledgeable menu. Food delicious. Ordered baked cauliflower fish chips kids cheese pizza. All delicious kids pizza huge portion. recommend would visit place again. ] tried restuarant now 4 times each time loses star but tonight final visit..
1 The inside loud hard carry conversation love sit outside but tonight very loud DJ which made inside seem quiet.  also kept sounding off loud horn which quite annoying.  ambiance does reflect restuarants name Public School seems more loud bar sub par disconnected menu.
2 ordered Salmon  vegetables steak salad...The salmon delicious but vegetables tasted dish soap lettuce served 4 pieces thinly sliced steak looked tasted day old bag lettuce...a little salt pepper would nice enhance some flavor but server never returned until done meal.
3 ordered 3 glasses wine 1 califlower appetizer 1 Steak Salad 1 Salmon vegetables..approximately $95.00.  did take $11.00 off dish soap veggies but service challenging paying almost $100.00 very disappointing.  unfortunate since great location. Public School 702 kind place people idea unique food drink but don't really good food drink. feels sad rip off farm to table places serving memorable meals Portland Denver beyond.

On plus really liked atmosphere.  Cool upstairs location. Neat notebook style menu napkins themed post notes. Very cool.

The beer list good. But beware don't actually lot stuff. first two beer choices met sorry we're that. includes Sierra Nevada Killerweis. exactly impossible keep stock.

The server very kind forgot put order grilled Cauliflower appetizer. bad because most reviews well companion raved dish.

We ordered couple different things. uninspired steak salad short ribs. Perhaps understanding short ribs off. But crockpot style roast bed flavorless mashed potatoes. 

So it. Probably good place happy hour drink 3. But must say missing beers never appearing appetizers lackluster main course put place loss column me. 5 5 atmosphere 3 5 food. Unfortunately food outweighs atmosphere me. 
We ordered fish chips all breading! down some greasy but still feeling disgusting scraping off chunks breading. couldn't believe spent much such small pieces fish!
With prices expected lot more quality. think would good place happy hour but definitely full meal. cute patio area works well cool evenings! 
If you're sitting outside doing happy hour walk inside bar order. 
Park opposite end Dillards. Look Trufusion Lululemon. Service great. Sat bar bartenders super attentive great suggestions.  Even overheard people helping manager which think always great!  offered samples when didn't even ask they're suggestions pretty spot on. Great spot! Great food great service Victoria love having PS702 neighborhood.  Thanks another great night. worst places long time.  Food cooked properly very poor service.  several people party two ordered hamburgers.  well other med. well.  Both came red inside basically rare medium rare.  sent mine back server said would only take 3 minutes fix it.  12 minute later mine comes back everyone else done meal. You've all happen where really disrupts vib.  When finally showed side salad wilted warm sitting under heat lamp microwave.  sent back let them keep ate left wife's salad which way much dressing it .  other person rare burger sick later maybe should feel lucky.  

I spoke manager but some young guy he just smiled while talking if he thought funny.  even asked why he smiling he said am just happy guy end day don't even care.  new place now crowded but if don't learn cook fix incorrect order 702 seeing fewer fewer people drop by.  Beware. Love love place!!! fam came Vegas visit brother ended here. theme incredible food yummy Tim waiter awesome!!!! defiantly back!! Very good happy hour. Nice selection food good prices. Very good beer selection decent wine choices.  Service staff bit overwhelmed during happy hour but they'll work out. 

Great service brunch. regular menu available plus small brunch menu some additions would welcome. Great vegetable hash. French toast tasted terrific but bread could thinner Bloody Mary mix delicious. 

Definitely worth trying if you've yet been. Decent little hang spot work even mid day let's drink apps middle shopping hang out. Tad pricey servers aren't very knowledgeable items including food drinks. 

Had Fish Chips I know! Why?!?! don't recommend it. Great atmosphere loved school deco! Service great. felt food overpriced was. However Thai noodle salad burger good. beet pink cocktail drink taste medicine. Love restaurant happy hour fantastic far items chose menu fantastic well taken client family there. food pretty good but poor service ruined experience. probably won't back because many other great choices Downtown Summerlin. 
When server first came over asked question cocktails menu she didn't know anything it. ordered drinks appetizer deviled eggs very good . finished drinks appetizer sitting holding menus wanting order food. She walked past several times without stopping ask if wanted order. finally flagged down she said oh thought already ordered guess different table . 
We ordered Huntsman burger Bison burger both pretty good. When food came asked side dressing which never got. food delivered runner server never checked back see everything ok. 
Also don't order soda rip off. husband ordered Diet Coke came glass 8oz bottle charge $2.75 for. 
The need work service if want stay open. Hopefully because decor unique food solid. Food delicious place unique theme. fun going through menu although weren't many choices eat. location good downtown summerlin great place shop! Prices cheap but super expensive customer service great! first time Public School tried Outer Darkness grabbed Chicken sausage pizza bartender time Coner suggested Tart Darkness fell love. amazong expeirence looking forward coming back soon.. Although music expected establishment. lunch today say wasn't very impressed. truffle fries just okay cauliflower which House fav very overrated. Nothing really wrong but definitely below expectations. then BBQ bison burger which pretty good but again memorable. say carrot slaw really tasty gastro pub food all about! MAC super disappointing. flavors did well together all. cobbler smallest bit ice cream blackberries bit tart weren't impressed either. decor great well thought thru. Good food. Good drinks. Good service. ordered 2 lagunitas jungle juice coffee flavored beer. 
Ahi tacos 
Tarter tots 
Mac cheese 
Grits 
Pep pizza 
A burger 
Mashed potatoes Third visit. Great patio decent sports bar food but MIND NUMBING LOUD inside!  worth if can't sit outside.  Also there's almost always wait outside frankly even best day place worth wait. recommended. Hot server hot food request Peter! 7 sat patio 9 01 pm 9 45 pm visited server ZERO times. Once realized going any service bar when 1 asked water bartender rolled eyes us.  ordered 6 cocktails beers them. Very doubtful return. Great place beer drinks food. beer selection really great food amazing!! crowded bartenders both times come very knowledgeable helpful.  Love here! First time visited PS 702 happily say great lunch experience. each beer shared cutting board chucarterie. loved it. meat cheeses olive oil bread excellent. also shared 4 mini tuna tacos appetizer. atmosphere awesome sit outside next time. server Lauren friendly knowledgeable efficient   a sweetheart. general manager bought beer us. 5 stars all around back guests try some main entrée items. Kudos all. three times now disappointed. Mellow environment both indoor outdoor seating. Jidori chicken jalapeño cheddar waffle delicious. Great choice unique sides. House pizza also solid choice. Super overpriced everything 2 little skirt steak tacos 13$??? Fries tasteless   Overpriced beers. Undereducated staff. Food good but pretty disappointing. Cool place tho.  Lots potential bad crap now!! Came today. Food good service terrible.  waited waited waited between each part experience. keep trying hail waitress.  ended sitting WAY long water silverware bill then problem bill.  Ugh. great time here! food excellent service atmosphere. waitress Sheena best even staff waiting asked liked everything made sure happy. whole staff amazing attentive. can't wait back again again! area decided try lunch friends all recommended it.
We no wait lunch seated right away.
We tried Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower starter....
which amazing! portion enough 2 share.
Since lunch decided share Fish Chips which also very good.
The fish portions large enough 2 share...and brown sack fries crispy tasty.
They great beer list both tap bottle but need update rotating list entrance first 2 choices both out.

Over all great lunch. Great brunch! lemonade handmade bartender bottomless common town. eat again! Located Downtown Summerlin. Ok may win any awards service but say weekend brunch almost bottomless Bloody Mary $10 quite deal Bloody Mary garnished among other things chicken wing allow repeat CHICKEN WING!!!!!  Also try Beermosa. say theta very good happy hour well. worth stop early weekends avoid crowd. Live Las Vegas Cryin' Loud! Fried Cauliflower awesome 
Need Ahi Tuna Tacos every time come. 
Fig prosciutto pizza amazing. 

The beer menu pretty good rotating drafts even better. Try new beer you've never don't stick same old cap. Expand your horizons! Don't order coors bud Miller shock top blue moon try other beers! might find something like! food amazing. Tater tots parmesan fries favorite. servers all over place. Mine half inside half out. Why?!? can't properly serve tables when you're running all over whole restaurant. Drinks take longer should. co worker early lunch last Thursday amazing experience he Huntsman cauliflower pepperoni pizza all loved! . 
However other hand did not. 
I called order pizza. order taker very kind triple checked all info. When arrived bunch people blocking doorway waiting tables unwilling let through. Once past bar pickup see food sitting cold counter. rather upset.

The bartender very nice greeted under minute attended order immediately smile. Did best nice back but couldn't shake agitation food sitting out. falsely assumed would remain under heat lamp until pick up. guess sat 5 10m luke warm once car. 

Overall give place more try maybe... But only dining in only when slow. 

I'd advise people never take out. cool spot grab food drinks Downtown Summerlin. 

We came dinner Saturday night. booth patio perfect beautiful night. waitress great. She great feedback menu very attentive. 

I started Crushed Velvet which basically lavender berry mule. best drinks awhile loved it. Cheddar Bacon Tots food starter. great flavor loved crispy outer layer. sriracha ketchup really set off flavors. 

For dinner enjoyed CCB which described chicken burger version Cobb salad. lot flavors made pretty good but very messy. sure mind blowing I'd order again. carrot slaw side oddly few carrot shavings but flavor okay. husband Fried Chicken Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. He loved unique combination. 

I haven't opportunity visit Happy Hour but menu looks awesome. definitely try return visit try Happy Hour. favorite breakfast brunch place Las Vegas! chicken waffle good criminal! always ask gravy served side giant bowl because seriously eat side dish. humus toast also indulgence. Pair unlimited cocktails would need bee wheel barreled restaurant. enjoy spaciousness restaurant. never busy nor empty but perfect family crowd. just tried 702 again last night much better. food very good beer selection good. happy hour tater tots pb j burger bites buffalo cauliflower. two Stone Tangerine Express IPAs husband two well glass house red wine. Plenty eat drink bill $65 tip. sat bar. service good but  area feel could improve upon. happy see no longer twenty one year old bartenders standing around chatting. bartenders more mature attentive but could slightly more attentive. wait couple times order dirty plates front bit long. wasn't super busy just average crowd. interaction bartenders good. nice good suggestions just need step attending needs customers. bar. Very good service. But dining room bit cluster f@ k. service bar way small servers wait line drinks. bartenders rock but don't any room appropriately place drinks upon completion. happy hour menu ok. But price portions bit small. Great atmosphere. Huge room oversized deck. Fun place lot potential. don't think ever gotten Yelp bash local eateries while isn't outright bashing wow some really bad service.  party 8 seated promptly but 15 minutes before server approached took drink orders. 15 minutes later most of drink orders arrived since ordered wait another 5 minutes .  menu some interesting items but overall meh food took forever arrive. Some party commented plates sitting under heat lamps forever turns ours. Fish chips sat easily 20 minutes fries soggy could imagine. buddy asked more ketchup never arrived. ordered extra round drinks 10 minutes same friend bar them himself. While he ran into server which little awkward server commented drinks ended bringing round ordered anyway now extra round table getting warm. least won't wait next round arrive.  
Bottom line all options Downtown Summerlin restaurant really needs bring its game. soggy food REALLY bad service regret suggesting monthly together. won't back. Came brunch. Beautiful Day beautiful view patio altogether beautiful experience! Enjoyed Almost bottonless mimosas toi First time let started...
It's Saturday night but busy all. chose sit outside due being LOUD! 

Dinner ok. bangers mash. Chicken herb bangers but mash excellent! Yum! Other guest fish chips. He liked it. 

Dessert total miss. blackberry cobbler. Gross! tiny bit crumble top. blackberry seeds kept getting stuck teeth. Other guest brownie. more thick chocolate cake but ruined chili powder top. didn't finish dessert. 

The decor cool. School themed even menus. back try another dish! Having came first time picked wrong time come. 5 30 pm Friday...it's Cougarville city here. inside restaurant packed no seating all noise deafening. glad able find seat outside. Even outside getting super packed. If tables full people sitting arms couches standing. 

Our server Vanessa incredible. Honestly awhile since received such good service. She great beer appetizer suggestions. busy she let know things would take awhile come out. concept! feel more waitstaff members Vegas need doing this! easy set realistic expectations enable diners plan accordingly. 

Drink orders warned took awhile. But surprised quickly everything else came out. total order two rounds beers two appetizers Buffalo cauliflower Mezza plate. mezza plate white bean hummus. if hummus hater despair. Try instead! buffalo cauliflower DOES live hype. IT. Don't think just it. Although really fan chunky blue cheese dressing this. 

Added bonus waitress noticed much humus enough bread brought more free charge. 

Thank Vanessa amazing service! visit without ordering Cutting Board appetizer. Great location atmosphere beer selection. Never full meal but enjoyed apps beer. Great service. great afternoon Public School 702 little lunch date hubby friends. never needed little help thankfully ha best waitress! Aimee Bond helpful welcoming making sure everything perfect. She upbeat very friendly while maintaining professional positive attitude. definitely coming back looking section!! Great service delicious food. friends came brunch let say love place. Everything flavorful came quickly. Plus $10 almost bottomless mimosas such deal. doesn't happy hour Friday? Drink food specials available. All food came delicious promptly. Clean environment fast service. Michael amazing server!!! Sad see crushed velvet cocktail but always excellent!!! Food wonderful but service good. Reservations made weeks advance birthday luncheon 12. busy yet 30 minutes before drinks arrived. food came server never came back refill drinks. obviously celebrating birthday...balloons birthday decorations but brought check without even asking if wanted dessert. very disappointed embarrassed host party. several times before much better service thought would great place being friends party. First off let say expensive place compared amount food ridiculous. menu short half beers brews. food overly spicy everything spicy! burgers ribs linguine meatballs even eggs. $65 two people eat. disappointing say least. recommended returning Public School 702 ever again. give guys shortest possible version server brought 23 month old son spicy SRIRACHA ketchup kids fries didn't realize until he started CHOKING booth tears eyes frantically asking water. No apology just oh god bad!! bring regular ketchup. shaken could barely speak server couldn't care less. poor baby. Then mom found short grey hair salad which server told mom she wrong ginger. pretty sure ginger doesn't cuticle am hairstylist know hair looks like. look daily. both lost appetites server never checked see son never apologized thing manager never even came over say word. still paid $35 bill still left 20% tip because don't believe tipping but never back urge everyone else same. Great beer. Great wings. Great happy hour specials. Service slow bit but  fine bad enough knock star off Fantastic food server Tyler awesome! first time visiting Resturant incredible! appetizers delicious steak good! Give try hope lucky enough seated Tyler's section but am sure all fantastic but Tyler outstanding! posted review awhile back please enjoyed past but say customer service tonight gets F! sit bar patio area watched server upon server passed right group if didn't exist also saw table next mine being cleared 5 employees again checked group. am pretty disappointed always recommended place friends family but no longer case bad customer service ruins reputation hope employees management joint realize it. Everything delicious. Started old fashioned if  all taste new favorite drink. tuna appetizer fried potato appetizer. Both excellent. both ordered steak Mac n cheese. excellent. couldn't decide better steak Mac n cheese. sat balcony wait 10 15 minutes seat but worth it. view looks park area. nice but still casual. definitely back probably try brunch. today during happy hr. first time here.  its big restaurant cool decor too.  happy hr prices pretty good everything ranged $5 7 items. tried naked wings fries margharita pizza adobo tacos.  would repeat all except tacos bland boring being more expensive items hh menu. 
yes food good. however service horrendous. waitress took 15 min water! still didnt order yet 15 min...  ordered beer n diet coke. beer coke diet.  when mentioned she gave heavy breath look fault n would huge problem back n diet coke since actual glass bottles. said forget n let be. but u really enjoy annoyed look u mess up.  btw 2 apps before beer wrong soda. thats long she took!  
there many runners bringing food kitchen. also lucky runner dropped lemon aioli fries dish off table narrowingly missing wife's shirt n pants. she apologetic but never replaced aioli.  ask when another runner came by.  
overall ok... beer good food good atmosphere good....service GOOD! Colby great. He attentive made sure happy! He only reason 5 star. chicken waffles won table. lamb burger good great. steak mushroom salad mid rare steak cooked properly but arugula didn't plate justice also portion greens off price. OMG place amazing!  food excellent staff exceptionally friendly attentive!  Shoutout Sheri always gives BEST customer service ever.  Would recommend place everyone! trouble writing review initially because really wasn't sure whether give three four stars. those really wish could give 3.5 but doesn't exist. really thought food matters giving three unfortunately. many times. happy hour brunch dinner. Lately stick just going brunch almost thought us. $10 four drinks which include bloody Mary beermosa mimosa Michelada. few things choose brunch menu far food. think tried just everything. last time  particular sausage grits fried chicken waffles avocado hummus toast. sausage grits actually quite good. would give four five. grits kind come firm grit cake covered sausage gravy bacon it. Definitely something would order again. avocado toast OK. avocado edamame taste wasn't huge fan of. But good came two big slices bacon top which made better because bacon everything better. Now chicken waffles. recommended server. wanted something little bit sweet along savory dishes. Well sweet. basically savory waffle corn came gravy instead maple syrup some fried chicken just average. would give dish two 2.5 best. definitely would order again. sweet savory if  you're looking for. just underwhelmed whole experience. 

Bonus tip though if order Bloody Mary first comes chicken wing! Public School fun little gastropub great selection food beers. San Diego County CA pleased see some favorite brews back home menu!

Their buffalo cauliflower MUST HAVE. ambiance service Tyler great! really whole experience Public School worth 5 stars. place amazing. food flavorful. fried cauliflower tuna tacos CCB sand which. All them amazing. 

The service also phenomenal. server Conner definitely him. He best servers ever had. He super friendly polite knowledgeable menu all amazing beers have. Check place out! First time thought decor theme very fun. atmosphere great too. all enjoyed food very much very flavorful lots choose from. 

HOWEVER... service     SLOW SLOW SLOWWWWWW!!! Hence 3 star review. What's deal!!??!! waiter nice but very forgetful. Drinks seemed take very long time. drinks opinion overpriced.. isn't strip freakin Summerlin.. why price gouge locals? Jack Daniels water somewhere around $20. Come on! 

My grilled salmon absolutely delicious. $21 but worth it. friends enjoyed deviled egg appetizers tater tots. Again food very good but service need improve. Couldn't tell if waiter kitchen bar all above made everything seem slow. sure come back anytime soon. really place. When walk cool grade school interior. bar area lab tables put shoulder shoulder others which awesome socializing. dining room really neat solar system light above. food delicious service really good. fathers day giving all men free choice draft beer fathers day. Pretty cool. definitely back First time happy hour. Chorizo Mac cheese tasty. also tried Frito pie homemade chili cheese red onions pickled jalapeños dry uninspired definitely chill. Then tried American Sidekicks three mini cheeseburgers all bun small meatball burger dry over cooked. all all pass one. Fun atmosphere decor school themed. love outside patio giant jenga beer pong tables.

We ordered Tuscan chopped salad kale tomatoes soppressata burrata crispy prosciutto. Per menu also supposed chickpeas but whole salad only able find seriuosly one! . But overall good good size portion sharing. pizza ordered basic margherita ok. crust thin which but almost thin towards center when pick slice fold it. think could cooked bit longer? 

We awesome server Erin. She really hustling us. group ordering lot drinks she top she checked very frequently. aside Erin heres kinks drink service could really use some work. took looooong time drinks. give idea sat down ordered drinks right away. 5 min ready order food. food came before even gotten drinks!? isnt servers fault just need better system bar. New place takes time. Overall place would recommend checking out. Food selection excellent. Great fresh food prepared perfectly. Great happy hour deals regular menu items still great price getting. few standouts burger chorizo Mac n cheese meat cheese plate Tuscan kale salad farro salad. 3 times less 2 weeks definitely back. Service food great! best part server Jared smith made jokes made laugh. Only issue management could find table party 10 happy hour disappointing. Jared made fun made some ok jokes but funny few drinks! def come back co workers Friday nigh. wish ranch dressing but great experience hard week work. Wish more $$ leave better tip. Thank Jared making first encounter PS702 great one. def come back again. P.S. Kudos chef. group friends came Sunday lunch morning hiking red rock. easily able table around 12 around 1pm. loved set place huge! also life sized jenga checkers few other games. vibe definitely fun causal.

As food stuck between lunch brunch but decided CCB burger. little bit messy eat but delicious! favors all meshed together very well meat cooked perfectly. also came side tasty French fries siracha ketchup. Yum!

I thought place pretty good! did seem little bit pricey but most likely because location downtown summerlin. Honestly didn't wanna come here.  Magianos spell check brain far Italian but only places open lunch. IM HAPPY ENDED !  First things first service amazing !  sat bar  Tom bartender.  He more accommodating.  Id considered would call challenging customer.  He accommodating answered all questions without hesitation. beer list fantastic list liquor.  lot things never heard including GInsky.  When asked smell bottle Tom kind enough pour small taster.  sure enough because he made sale ! stuff amazing ! boyfriend fish chips raved it! All sauces own spin which also super fun ! steak Cobb salad.  steak cooked just way asked once didn't need extra dressing asked for.   back!  happy stumbled gem ! place great all. Busy but don't why is. Service sucks food sucks. bathroom messiest bathroom ever seen any restaurant. Trash all over place napkins restaurant floor no soap. won't going back. Thanks social media person being jerk online going back here. Business made destroyed through customer interaction. need take lesson other craft beer places Las Vegas. brunch last weekend. food food but super rich hard eat whole thing. ordered mimosas which almost bottomless brought carafe full mimosa mimosa just tasted only orange juice. Wasn't impressed everything over just wasn't bad either. Amazing. Original menu. Spidey chicken bison burger shorty bowl fantastic very original. Bottomless mimosas bomb!  Peter man!  Great times great food.  CCC.  Games kept kids entertained. Just moved Las Vegas usually own meals eating usually semi pleasurable. However restraunt awesome. vibes atmosphere fresh taste vegetables meats couples incredible list beers twist drinks Id say less expensive great meal few places come close!

I forget name but when back willl write another review but waiter door greeter extremely cool took care ny wife family true professionals. work customer service consider myself elite two guys made step game up!

Apps entrees drinks price taste cant it! stopped drink patio overlooking DTS fountain area. nice place drink enjoy nice weather. margaritas $11.75 each. served small rocks glass. good though. could tell made fresh lime juice sour mix.

We during happy hour ordered some apps happy hour menu.

$4 White Bean Hummus serve grilled pita. better hummus but good. really enjoyed grilled pita.

$4 Quinoa Salad very good. reminded quinoa tabouli without parsley.

The service great really dining area set patio bars. definitely back dinner. menu looks winner me. If apps preview lies ahead then think enjoy it.

I'll back! Waitress Very fast service great knowledge menu. Place clean tasty selection drinks food Solid spot great draft selection! Lots good local beers offered. don't kill people prices would come more often but kind far drive. Food decent but service spot waiter really cool. Lack attentive service knocks down review check. liked vibe menus items beer selections. waiter scarce once dinner dropped off other staff. Given opportunity would ordered another round but time he stuck head over half wall separating writer station table staring empty plates twenty minutes. worry though he promised those plates cleared away soon. took another ten minutes happen. 

Overall food decent beers tasty. Hope service improves next time check otherwise off list. Jordan server best ever! Accommodating all 4 generations Mother's Day food great too. Try Truffle frites!! Made reservations which needed Saturday.  Very funky old schools atmosphere text books menu look composition notebooks.   Everything good..the Cheese bacon Tator tots just ok husband's lamb burger suppose medium rare medium well...but he doesn't send food back issue.   Scrimp Grits interesting   Grits more Palenta cake grits fresh corn perfect!    Best item menu Cutting Board Chef selected meats artisian cheeses most delicious fig jam! came again today know matter time day always same amazing service food consistently amazing! love atmosphere everything school theme. You're also allowed sample beer before buy which great. Pretty crowded during HH but fun place check. Out. Food ok.   server seemed very unsure herself. 3 diet cokes didn't learn until bill came charge each drink. friend ordered burger without bun server came back 3 times questions. burger fries good but diet cokes spent $30 lunch.  Server dropped off credit card slips no thank nice day. Poor customer service. Don't think returning. most children friendly restaurant far! highly recommend any family young children. Super friendly stuff amazing food. can't wait next time ! 

During last visit daughter 3 months old cried non stop. She wouldn't eat she wouldn't sleep. tried everything then mother started help still nothing would work. outside patio just wouldn't interrupt other customers inside restaurant. Few minutes later tall gentleman mustache probably work kitchen area came outside frozen blueberries. He asked if daughter teething maybe blue berries help. 

This call going above beyond customers take initiatives exceed customer's expectation ! didn't chance name but 702 instantly became favorite restaurant!  Great job ! Service Bar Amazing! Louis super friendly knowledgeable beer. cute doesn't hurt Being able taste double IPA before committing always nice! Chicken waffles nice twist sweeter version served most place mashed potatoes side.....  uhhmmm yes please!   Seating outside suuuper amazing good weather!

Eventually drink came out. delightful think called crushed velvet refreshing tasty wonderful served sweaty copper mug lavender blackberries made smile. didn't meet bar tender but know would best friends. Now ready some food happy hour chose PB J sliders. Tiny burgers peanut butter jelly BACON?! Yes please. waved down server not ours because hadn't seen in... Forever asked if could order something eat. She hunted down girl she took order. sliders came timely manner delightful. bacon thick cooked perfection just right amount peanut butter jelly really made juicy burger babies pop. close time head downstairs see movie put best check please face looked around server once again gone forever. flagged down another server asked if could check rest party staying but needed head she found server abyss assume she brought check. she handed said hang sec card right now. when turned back around card bill she again gone. now three minutes till needed downstairs asked someone run check find girl. Which did speed walked movie alright.

Interesting tasting beer sure.

Chorizo Mac n Cheese AWESOME!  We're fans salt vinegar chips top off chorizo Mac n cheese just added extra pop.  does some greens kale but hardly noticeable those non veggie lovers.

Grilled Watermelon Heirloom Tomatoes Surprisingly great refreshing plate summer definitely winner book.

Chicken Green Chile Cornbread Waffles Heard lot great reviews but bit disappointed one.  chicken pretty tender but waffle itself pretty dry bit hard eat without extra gravy sauce top it.

Short Rib dish delicious!  Tender short rib draped over mashed potatoes some grilled onions.  came steaming hot but flavors spot.

Nutella Ice Cream Cookie lot reviews liked most part but few bites gets much.  decent size if group four would perfect split.  nice thing dessert ice cream bacon bits those bacon lovers!

Overall service great super friendly waitress.  She helpful suggestions also joked everyone when she came table.  We'll definitely coming back here! Simply put place rocks.  dinner last night some surprise birthday action really impressed.  servers let slow play dinner leaving space between drinks appy's entrees.  didn't any appetizers but did see faces those did...and very happy ones. few ape's ordered were buffalo cauliflower like hot wings but fried cauliflower instead deviled eggs looked awesome .

Between 13 everyone tried lots different food farro brussel salad seared scallops incredible!  flavor profile unique sweet curry dressing scallops cooked VERY well. I feel easy screw scallops did SUCH good job! bison burger looked fantastic mac cheese looked even better.  

OH beer menu LEGIT!  PLUS...can discuss amazing thing happened 9PM?  crazy buzzer off next 15 minutes all draft beers just DOLLAR.  15 minutes later buzzer off again $2. They every 15 minutes til 10PM. Also servers Jamie F freaking awesome.  asked help choose order she super thorough through handful dishes questions about. Plus ended getting really wanted. She even stopped sure liked afterward.  She really made experience much better us!

I definitely back! dining selection creative fun but often times presentation more enjoyable flavor. Great happy hour drink selection. Crispy Ahi Tuna Tacos reliable choice sea food lovers myself. ok super impressed food but atmosphere fun very close house but don't know if would recommend friend. great. love Aurelia! She best! Good times! Love it. All above. Grammar! Public school. Best time. Always. Love tender! friend came long hike red canyon. shared bison burger medium rare quinoa salad beets salad. burger good. brioche bun soft patty juicy. impressed. beet salad okay. overly drenched balsamic dressing. Overall good lunch favorite dishes Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower Bacon Cheddar Tots. made visit without ordering both dishes start meal. Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower $7 fried buffalo sauce batter crispy tender! perfectly served blue cheese aioli buffalo sauce. would visit just dish! Bacon Cheddar Tots $7 great pace myself sure don't devour quickly. don't love Sriracha Ketchup accompanies tots flavor off seems bit sweet. tots don't need sauce anyway but also comes fries.

Chicken Sausage Spinach Goat Cheese Pizza $15 béchamel roasted tomato provolone chili flakes. loved combination ingredients such great flavor though wish more tomato it pretty scarce . also burned pizza around edges unpleasant. But otherwise great pie.

I've Crispy Chicken Sandwich $14 couple times really enjoyed it. chicken nice crisp decently moist love slaw. thing really puts over edge sauces sweet carrot habanero aïoli mustard BBQ fantastic! served Brown Paper Bag Fries. decent fry scale.

The only dish haven't liked Bangers Mash. Everything odd it. flavor sausages flavor mash.. good. friend couldn't take more couple bites before shoving aside.

From brunch Chicken Sausage Cheddar Grits $13 Eggs Benedict Pizza $13 . grits phenomenal overall dish just sings highly recommended. pizza good but needs touch more prosciutto hollandaise bit dry.

I don't always dessert but really glad convinced try Nutella Cookie Sandwich $7 . cookies surprisingly chewy oh heaven ice cream bacon pecan brittle Nutella drizzle. won't regret it. reserve right increase next time because give them another chance. 702 located real nice fancy clean outdoor mall shopping center. decor clever overall restaurant clean. support staff nice try best. getting seated took solid 7 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged asked drinks. took 15 18 minutes before drinks water came 8 minutes . Then another 10 take order. Once ordered appetizer took 15 minutes food took closer 25 Dad's pizza took another 10 that!

The food solid although wish more choices. visit LV Henderson Summerlin area frequently try them again. would suggest working speeding kitchen attentiveness staff. Other decent experience. Boyfriend took surprise brunch! 
LOVE patio almost bottomless drinks bloody mary served chicken wing amazing along beermosa. 
The Benedict Pizza really tasty. 
Can't wait back! took lunch group Public School 702 Downtown Summerlin today! much fun. Great atmosphere. waiter excellent! Everyone said food wonderful! Reminds Yardhouse Red Rock but food much better! favorite restaurants Downtown Summerlin. enjoyed chorizo mac cheese buffalo cauliflower shrimp grits! also ordered ahi tuna poke which wasn't really fan of. comes mango tangy sauce which don't think belongs tuna should belong cocktail drink. Food comes pretty fast love ambiance place. having small picnic classroom composition journal style menus. If you're looking brunch when almost bottomless mimosas or beermosas micheladas bloody Mary's great spot. 4 rounds $15 but feel every time come they're always short staffed probably always going waiting something. 

Besides buffalo cauliflower must love naked wings chorizo mac cheese must potato nuggets cheese bacon whatever. always feel ordering bunch small plates always satisfied. never catch myself ordering actual entrees even brunch but some looks really good. 

I give waitress credit hooking extra round mimosas while waited friend finish last drink giving extra star but truly more 3 3.5 star kind rating. Unfortunately service consistent every visit whether they're short staffed whatever may be. 

I'll still back still enjoy brunch happy hour but still hope day more speedy better service. place joke! Tried reserve table bday party co workers back June but manager Nick being asshole never returned call calling cell calling restaurant several times leaving message staff confirm reservations since party 10. 2 days calling them them answering any messages. Finally fed emailed corporate office voila next day Nick emails apology now able accomodate party but course already made reservations another place at Lazy Dog which literally just took 2 mins. over phone do. review service that never food drinks never chance try em. Cool place. great if want good service sat bar area ordered beer two glasses wine. took little over 15 minutes drinks then waitress couldn't remember what. Place wasn't horribly busy either. Sad seems place could lot fun but sure we'll back. friend Vegas Summerlin local suggested check Public School because cool vibe new plaza built. 

We came around 9PM Sunday night wasn't busy. hostess told could sit anywhere bar area grabbed table menus brought almost immediately. server then came bottle water two cups us. 

I loved ambiance because super cute hipster like. felt would place could find somewhere Portland. decor mirrors classroom yearbooks dictionaries encyclopedias math cards all jazz around restaurant. menus itself look composition notebooks theme followed through every aspect venue. 

We Citra Rye Pale Ale. Now much beer drinker but lychee grapefruit scent followed bitterness beer which nice. thoroughly enjoyed wasn't even expensive! $5 glass goodness. Perhaps step towards developing taste beer. 

We then ordered brown bag fries. fries perfectly cooked came Siracha Ketchup mustard BBQ sauce. ketchup overpowered Siracha smell Siracha but taste very faint. mustard BBQ sauce almost tastes honey bbq. Quite interesting.

We also Cutting Board which assortment artisan cheeses cured meats. goat cheese blue cheese sheep cheese prosciutto salami. also cashews jam onions other little things board toasted artisan bread thinly sliced middle. All very interesting tasty. chef's choice probably changes day to day. 

I loved atmosphere place cool everything is. definitely want visit again next time come into town. Came last Friday night just barely missed 'Recess'. 

Overall worst. But price there's lot other restaurants I'd rather visit Friday night downtown Summerlin. 

Appetizer We ordered bacon cheddar tots which extremely oily but nice creamy inside sriracha ketchup added nice sweet spicy flavor it.

Main dishes Chicken burger forget name bc extremely forgettable. Bland but chicken juicy. side quinoa which didn't feta advertised dry.

Bangers Mash chicken sausages just okay mashed potatoes bacon shredded sautéed Brussels sprouts good but good enough save entire dish. 

BBQ Bison burger asked medium rare but basically well done. extremely flavorful seasoned. Would pass next time. 

The waitress delivered dishes dropped hefty handful fries floor she placing plate table. She apologized didn't mind but she said she'd come back more fries it...which she never did. couldn't find incident couldn't ask follow up. 

Beer flight The IPA actually half bad earthy hop average. nice option $5 sampler. 


Overall Nice atmosphere gather friends appetizers during happy hour. Main entrees ordering appetizers post recess hh worth it. Cheesy bacon brussels mash. need more air breath. tried multiple dishes Public School over past month keep coming back more. yet disappointed! Came lunch coworkers pepperoni pizza. super greasy crunchy all. barely cheese pizza. sauce wasn't enough. could only taste plain soggy dough. If haven't tried place seriously missing out. patio must everything menu amazing. completely cool experience. if land Vanessa server great education beers offer both special regular menu. She rocks! Loved atmosphere everything school themed. waitress extremely prompt when bringing more unlimited mimosas. Even brought carafe easier. food absolutely delicious! starters made reservation group sit patio. When said would wait 2 hours sit patio ended sitting inside. point making reservation if needed wait 2 hours? waitress inattentive mediocre best. tried order drinks but didn't most wanted. bar Las Vegas doesn't Red Bull Belvedere vodka Captain Morgan fireball? ordered naked wings requested ranch dressing but said never ranch dressing. 

The empty glasses kept accumulating table ordered round round drinks. She never took empty glasses away. waitress disappeared long periods time even though weren't really even busy. When asked checks end meal all incorrect.  

In ladies restroom complete mess. no toilet paper stalls floors messy. When left restaurant told hostess. She asked if anybody vomited restroom. She made sound if lack vomit floor made all rest mess acceptable. very cool trendy new bar! brunch best chicken waffles ever! green chili cornbread waffles tasty very original. menu somewhat limited but entrées unique made high quality ingredients. jungle juice cocktail refreshing drink. also nice variety draft beer including some rare taps. happy hour day wedding which turned party 25.  Sat casual dining area 2 tables 10.  Appetizers super reasonable $4 $5 $6 $7.  Beers $7.  sliders hummus flatbread wings.  great way end wedding weekend check Public School last Tuesday since live right Downtown Summerlin. vibe pretty chill waitress cute attentive. cutting board appetizer but could mess cheese cold cuts bread right?..Went pepperoni pizza main which biggest mistake life gross greasy salty . Literally equivalent eating Little Caesars someone drenched 2 lbs oil. gonna complain but waitress Courtney but she recommended good wine liked her plus ate all because dying starvation. Conclusion never order pizza Public School. probably should gone shrimp grits waitress recommended Summers Cabernet she recommended good. 

Cheers! Fantastic happy hour great light bites such mushroom fontina flatbread deviled eggs...yes...the eggs! decor quirky unique but just you'd expect Public School. sure before buzzer take advantage entire happy hour menu!! wanted try place sorry say impressed. wife each tried different burger. bison BBQ burger she moody burger. Both middle road great but horrible. sons girlfriend she shrimp grits. According no flavor dish. 

Service slow together.  Water took over 5 minutes when first sat down  took waitress awhile even greet us. asked extra catsup when she finally brought put front sons girlfriend. sure if she new but definitely needs work. mixed bag. tomato watermelon salad amazing fried chicken waffles. No issues food all. service wonky. early 5 00 Tuesday couldn't seem figure supposed waiting us. plan giving another shot because food great. Beautiful space fortunately mostly empty when because bet gets crazy loud when full. Did stay Whole Restaurant break 20 Minutes!  Whet California Pizza stead. whole theme restaurant. takes ya back elementary school days. walk through dining area come upon giant globes hanging ceiling which reminded just solar system school library. seated table chairs but also booths bar seating. chairs cute small scale black metal chair course following school motif but all comfortable. very noisy but didn't affect conversation much. menu very different but some safe choices too. Bangers mash fish chips pizza etc. ordered Mac cheese app meal accompanied cup tortilla soup. soup forgotten ask big deal..it wasn't spicy just right amount. Mac chorizo which found way salty. friend fish chips. She said good but fries even better! appetizer opted calamari. came ginger aioli delish. calamari heavily breaded but ok. I'd back when bit warmer outdoor seating looking down courtyard. asked to go box also received brown paper bag labeled 'homework' cute! Place legit great beer selection friendly staff nice party scene highly recommend. O ya cool ass doctor bought shots whole bar! Holy crap. Haven't food yet but place dam LOUD. Won't back. Literally two people over can't hear dam thing. first around designing eatery? Sheesh. Service beyond sub par. seated did greeted server least 8 10 minutes. When she finally came just say right then she proceeded pick dishes empty tables talk table next desert. She finally came back took order appetizer came shortly but cold. food just average. water glasses also stayed empty whole time once did offered refill. noticed every other table actually water carafe refill own glasses but did not. definitely won't returning friend highly recommended place way higher expectations fulfilled all. honestly say only thing enjoyed place view outdoor seating place awesome!! family Dinner Birthday. chorizo Mac n Cheese cutting board starters...it awesome!!! suggested few favorites staff... ordered every recommendation. chicken sandwich truffle fries die for...all amazing flavors sweet kick spice combined truffle fries...Omgee!!! Your mouth exploded variety flavors...the shrimp grits would think having that.....I tell bomb!!! right Jane...writing review having craving more!!! highlight dinner manager Jane!!! She awesome answering all questions made experience more memorable upbeat positivity!! Thank Jane your Team!! don't write many reviews Yelp testify to! Lol! . anniversary decided come here. skirt steak Brussels sprouts husband fish chips. both fabulous!  service OK but food awesome! bacon cheddar tator tots app good too. Best fish fry Las Vegas found coming Wisconsinites! Public School 702! come back! absolute favorite restaurant. love atmosphere sometimes live music usually always good amount people there. really enjoy cauliflower starter. burgers great well. favorite thing definitely shrimp grits bangers mash. Can't wrong restaurant! last night couple girlfriends check out. Overall just...decent. theme ambiance. carried school theme very well decor fun. ordered food off happy hour regular menu. friend Parmesan fries which excellent wings cauliflower which she said just ok good. other girlfriend ordered poblano quinoa. pepper good but rice very bland almost no flavor all. $16 it. ordered margherita pizza which good once it. Unfortunately forgot took awhile. good thing comped which nice done without asking. 

My only complaint drink prices. spent $27 two glasses wine. nothing special just house Chardonnay. $11 glass outrageous house glass wine. also noticed happy hour beers very very limited. Regular cocktail prices upwards $15 $16 piece. 

Overall decent. probably won't back unless ends being meeting place decided others. Average burger n fries. Good beer choices. Service people good intentions no exprience. burgee punched different item ext$4 never received last beer order. Waited 15 min. Didnt wanna argue over bill. last beer wasnt charged just never received when weather nice patio worth it. best happy hours ever great choices great pricing. Love I'd back anytime Public school impressed me. concept creative. chicken grits.
Our waitress Ruth amazing! Down earth knowledgeable frank she's very charismatic. only thing better food service see previous paragraph place did right!!!!! twice both times terrible service. first time happy hour group 5. server took order never saw again until flag down check. addition non existent waiter didn't receive drinks until already received check. decided give them second chance last night industry night around 9 o'clock. sat bar area high hopes because busy. saw least 3 waiters walk past table no acknowledgement towards us. waiting 20 minutes no coming take order left. decided Yard House where bartenders friendly service great! return Public School 702. Shady service! Put down few hundred open tab bar few beers then order few appetizers table while playing games. opened two tabs bartender says closed tab pay second one. Basically pocketed rest cash. He wouldn't show tab he closed either. Garbage. Such awesome place service point. little disappointed see menu more expansive but still found great items eat.

Their menu seems more beer drinks. ambiance great would awesome place hang eat drink friends without having club. 

We sat patio area restaurant beautiful. conversation good didn't realize food hadn't come hour. waitress very attentive actually brought attention. came back apologize bought another round drinks us. Awesome save Public School 702. Loved atmosphere choices beers. place reminded restaurants San Diego! Service really good cocktails very yummy. Passion fruit mojito tastes really refreshing. forgot name but coffee  cocktail good strong. food however mehhhh. ahi poke decent passion fruit sauce but fish didn't taste fresh. Now entree. fish chips wow inside less barely warm wayyyy much batter. ended just eating fish inside left batter. Fries could crispier. soggy opinion. Definitely ask bbq honey sauce dip your fries in. All all would come back just drinks maybe some bar food during happy hour. don't think entrees worth $$$. finally made over public school week hearing much it.   Maybe expectations high but thought just ok.  thought beer selection really nice but burger just OK very pricey.   think cheaper eat strip!   patio vibe bump 4 stars. place best happy hour bartender Conner amazing! Super knowledgeable all different kinds beers definitely made experience awesome! Food service good appetizer fries small. asked outside seating when making reservation but told none available could accommodate. did watch walk ins taken outside seated seated inside. Public School 702 does give military discounts either. place when wife want good beer something light eat. appetizers point shrimp grits best around. never wrong fish chips. Also amazing atmosphere. sure order buffalo cauliflower  eating healthy chicken wings Ate hubby couple months ago. Superb food. Very clean reataurant...Atmosphere point abd though menu surprisingly small quality there. excellent time. husband even surprise message GM because happy restaurant staff service...he comped nice gift card! Thanks public school dining pretty soon! recommend bison burgers snd some local brews! very fun time here. energy uplifting positive servers all looked enjoying job. service outstanding. Amanda server she made time spent very pleasurable. She very knowledgable menu drinks more willing explain items well offer beer samples. grilled watermelon excellent. burger which cooked just way ordered it. see eatery only getting better. off great start. return!! place super fun thinking making every Sunday funday spot. large group well taken care waitress BRITTANY she did great job super friendly. brunch menus some great options did drink menus swordfish great but son's fish chips wasn't good. very dry bland didn't any flavor all without putting sauce it. 
I doubt return future meals. food still very fresh margaritas excellent service great.  only complaint place now loud heck.  architecture high ceilings seem place into amplifier turned itself.  literally shout talk only half waitress saying. invited last minute wine event rock n roll wine hosting. appearance very chic modern reminding something East Coast where from. Just ordered crispy buffalo cauliflower hold on...Holy Moley! Thanks Bree heads up. Its delicious taste why its voted best Vegas. put ish everythang! back Emily Jason amazing. fiancé allergic mushrooms completely forgot tell them no mushrooms. distracted talking wedding forgot mention mushrooms. told Emily sorry forgot tell them no mushrooms. Without problem making burger mushrooms Jason able new without any hesitation. loved energy. just concerned fiancé trying sure he didn't take bite burger mushrooms. Plus Jason much energy passion. worked customer service tell when someone enjoys job loves customers happy. Great food great beers. Service hit miss times. improved tremendously since first week opened. patio impressive big. thought place cool! Everything set school hence name. menus looked composition note book specials brunch scan tron set menu. thought really clever liked concept.

You sit inside outside but since summertime Las Vegas sat inside. 

The chairs little uncomfortable but overall bad. 

I decided bottomless bloody marys. only $10 which thought great price. could only two though because spicy started heart burn. Next time I'd try bottomless mimosas instead wouldn't heartburn. 

We started deviled eggs. used chipotle sauce which made them taste amazing! highly recommend them.

I then veggie pizza. should shared someone because wasn't personal sized. tasted really good! goat cheese knew would. Its white based pizza well which nice change pace.

Our waiter really friendly knowledgeable. would visit place again. date night before movie wait 20mins sat bar area. Took forever drinks. Server friendly. Order poke app which great. Husband ordered steak salad didn't dressing. order tacos 2 2 meal... took bite GROSS! meat rare chewy soft basically seemed old. don't sending food bad. giving 2 stars thanks staff poke app. won't back feel wasted $75 meal pretty disappointed! Jess Thor awesome servers.  food very good.  Interesting cauliflower appetizer good way.  full dessert but sounded delish. Love patio seating here. perfect beautiful brunch even nice dinner al fresco... only con patio seating during brunch sun shine directly but ya do?! 

Our server really sweet though took some time table... She answered all questions gave recommendations.
The food just ok. shared chicken waffles healthy egg scramble. chicken bone gravy thick. scramble lots veggies. 

We also bottomless bubbles but bottomless certainly bottom 4 drinks per guest. carafe mimosa constitutes 3 drinks then bloody. Bloody Mary way thick spicy. wouldn't it. doesn't down well eating didn't satisfy Bloody Mary craving. also bloody beer Michelada. 

We may back outdoor seating. prices bad. BTW love school theme napkins menus!

HOT TIP Recess Happy Hour bar. Mon Fri 3 30 6 30. Discounts brews wines bites! Wish different categories rate Fish chips pretty good flaky needed touch salt maybe pepper.

We ordered flight understanding would 5 tastes......only 3 send 2 them back dirty glasses Waitress seemingly upset probably first customers if day guess interferes gossip time. Food good service all over place. Forgetting orders throughout just table. Service needs step lot. Heard fellow Yelper last minute changed plans instead Cheesecake Factory! glad made change friend.

We came placed very spacious well lighted natural light glass windows. globes ceiling very nostalgic. chalk boards even down weird smelling brown paper towels used elementary school I know also use other places but still .

Another surprise when sat down saw menu. throwback notebook scanttron test menu brunch napkins! Once down nostalgia overload and wanted grab pencil #2 fill test friend through menu. 

Everything decently priced wanted order everything but control ourselves. waitress Kaila suggested Beermosa... wow. didn't think beer champagne would great together but proven wrong. $10 bottomless why not?

We ordered mezze plate mac cheese ahi tuna nicoise.

Mezze plate looked could feed 3 4 people but between friend did best. highlight nice firm salty marinated feta tapenade hummus. Flatbread nicely grilled perfect. Downside babaghanoush needed more citrus salt seasoning. fried chickpeas ok. But next time try see if accommodate double babaghanoush hummus only 3

Ahi tuna nicoise great.  Big portion. Would serve 1 person full lunch meal but great split between two people. given wrong salad initially served scallop Brussels sprouts salad... tempted say yes salad she forgot  ahi but definitely coming back try salad . dressing great. Perfect citrus notes  over powering. take eggs being served deviled style nice surprise. Bibb lettuce lost its very little crunch meaning salad perfectly dressed . thing did care potatoes.  seemed thought composition no salt seasoning. Trying mix salad dressing didn't save just picked around it.

The fact stop ourselves order should tell portions great. bacon mac cheese.. man seeing those salt vinegar chips top.. love dish. cheesey dry. best mac cheeses sorry guys haven't Beecher's Mac Cheese .

These little nuances cause 4 star rating.  rating mostly amount  Beermosa refills had. guys definitely DW Bistro brunch place now but lag drink refills did in. tip myself future visits others small group... sit bar see if fill your drinks fly without wait.

Other definitely back along some friends near future!  Definitely come back try Recess! Excellent food but if you're coming bottomless mimosas Whist over Green Valley. three hours 2 mimosas. Slow service pre them flat. Horrible hands down worst bottomless mimosa brunch Vegas. teacher friends chance students PS702 Friday June 19th. truly say never more fun good food great atmosphere life. 10 total tried EVERYTHING menu food drinks. played some other games just soaked place in. fantastic. much fun having July birthday celebration there. love place !!!  buffalo cauliflower best service perfect . might wait but worth .. decor cool appropriate foh staff nice friendly. orders taken well given some good suggestions. need some more popular beers tap though just forcing drink craft beer. menu some nice some nice ideas. ordered flat iron steak medium rare came rare way many potato chip top Mac cheese came with. Also found old dried piece Canadian bacon Mac cheese turned off whole meal that. Decent ideas food but probably inexperienced cooks behind line cause experience  seems screw such expensive but simple dish. Probably won't come back long time. Grape street still way better. best server ever!!! name Britney Craig she excellent knowledge service personality most importantly kind.
I food! Interesting menu spice. Some people can't spice but case.....I Love it! Britney excellent! am server over 27 years. restaurant business own catering business well. She gets five stars!! Seriously if ask disappointed!! PS favorite dish spicy shrimp pasta actual name chorizo well lunch PS702 DTS awesome! Great gastropub food! Typically haven't fan style food but PS702 does right! Great portion sizes wait staff host great! excited back again try different things!!! Very nice place go.  Justin great greats old friend he hasn't seen while whether he k not.  Love happy hour specials.   Food good anything sure leave satisfied.   Great place.  Outdoors nice well. definitely back! Great place lunch!  Would definitely come back dinner. Mandi GREAT server. indoor patio seating. back sure! both brunch dinner everything ordered delicious. place really fun atmosphere servers staff friendly. If beer great beer list. brunch menu best town. personal favorites chicken waffles French toast. highly recommend spot! place cute different any other restaurant bar. 
However food isn't amazing. pretty normal. menu pretty small both lunch dinner. 
It's good place drink friends! study group section menu where share variety different beers which cool! 
I'd rather more local bar happy hour. should've listened reviews bad service avoided place all together. boyfriend walked no standing hostess stand except miserable waitress just rolled eyes when boyfriend said hello her. proceeded bar only disappointed once again bartender didn't time properly greet acknowledge us. Long story short decided place worth time money left. bad because seemed place potential. co worker happy hour loved food. Buffalo cauliflower delicious! also tried deviled eggs truffle fries wings all good. sad milk stout unavailable but looking forward next visit. Amazing service amazing brunch amazing atmosphere. Request Peter!! He's best! definitely come back more Rosé beer pong! brunch last Sunday.  all drink cheap.  food mediocre.  girlfriend became sick off Bloody Mary she received leave abruptly.  service good though. First visit Public School! lived Summerlin only few months moving Cali. sister came visit hunt food drinks cool environment. sister came across Public School mentioned knew but never been. 8 45p closing approaching 10p. seated right away hostess. Server Aurelia took care gave enough time look over drink order. ordered Rose drink Brussels cauliflower bites poblano quinoa much other good stuff share. Everything HOT FRESH delicious. also accommodating adjusting order vegan friendly! Which complicated sister but no problem here. Aurelia checked she awesome friendly! Also ordered chicken sandwich Togo she gave all sauces asked side nothing missed. Toward end meal visit GM Kevin. He very kind welcomed Public School! only back other friends but know sister return together. Thank Aurelia Kevin! See soon Great place eat. Server bit slow but she overwhelmed large group 10 15 well several filled tables nearby. food awesome seasonal beers always delicious. I'd recommend mac cheese side any meal favorite table. Great location.  enjoyed food although husband wasn't impressed frito pizza.   very close personal.  guests sit very close another.  music ridiculously loud can't hear person next saying.  guess could good bad depending with.   liked party 4 felt noise bit much.  looks going young crowd music noise but attract variety ages.... should consider toning down fit into clientele. place really really good!!!!! tots calamari huntsman burger ccb. also tried temperanillio wine local IPA beer blackberry Moscow mule type drink. Everything came timely manner interior beautiful all food amazing!
My only complaint soggy burger bun everything bit pricy but restaurant very typical hipster restaurant.

Overall back try rest beer try everything else! while since honestly cant remember every detail visit went. But remember review based on. 

We came during lunch weekday. Probably best time come because seated right away. nice seat view window. place decorated nice! Its modern but school theme. 
Hence name. 

I quickly started notice small things. USB Plugs every table.. Composition Looking Menu.. Edison Light Bulbs..
ALSO dirty cloth napkin sitting front me. White cotton napkin. wearing black being gentleman am placed white napkin lap. mistake. didnt lint roller me. 
Our waitress brought water. 2 dirty glasses dirty glass bottle filled chilled tap water. 
Were even washed?? 
2 strikes.. Waiting 3rd??
I ordered drink diet coke . menu never stated tiny bottles $2.50! told waitress.. wish said menu disclosed when ordered..most big restaurants pubs soda tap.
Well really disappointing. 

On food.

For starters tried Bacon Cheesy Tots. recommendation waitress. 
Deep fried golden brown perfection. Crispy outside high flavor! Sriracha Ketchup side! Yum!!

BBQ Bison Burger Quinoa Salad Wow! really damn good burger!!  Patty grilled perfection medium well me. BBQ sauce good sweet. Quinoa cooked perfect well. 

Now dont remember.. wife ordered HotDog some sort. checked online menu didn't see it. Maybe special something. 
Bun toasted yet soft center. hot dog itself overcooked. something see inside 7 11 when they've sitting rollers hours upon hours. But toppings made it. 

It ok visit lunch date. 
I'll try again. Maybe dinner date beautiful wife. Two trips two very different experiences.  want really place...location great decor vibe good...what's inconsistent service food. ordered Bison Burger myself kids slider new daughter...the sliders came rocks returned. sure why ever left kitchen? Staff...I don't know. First visit month ago waitress great attentive etc...last night hassle just interested. don't know...maybe off night but good second impression. Updating review. decided give place another try. Came lunch Tuesday afternoon. 4 12 17 Again menu seems limited but ordered edamame hummus which good. would've happy side salad along hummus but don't even offer that. Just ordered water time. waitress great though wish knew name. Although thoughts menu same least service much better time. probably won't return eat again options just aren't appealing they're very limited plant based diets. First timers today PS 702! food delicious! Great ambiance very clean restaurant. started speck eggs bacon cheddar tots sriracha ketchup. Both good. speck eggs didn't lot flavor found myself dipping lot. Then moved lunch green chili soup day amazing little spicy but we'll made. husband American burger which does come cheese heads up! American burger no cheese WHAT!?!? he added American cheese figure sons shared kids cheese pizza let tell huge. parents if want save little money since restaurant pricey order 1 kids cheese pizza all kids really big!!! 

 gave 4 star review instead 5 couple reasons. husband soda drinker complimentary refills! He happy that! only bottled soda! just isn't right especially when spicy foods! second reason took away star because food took while come mean 30 minutes! medium cooked burger cheese pizza cup premade chili take 30 minutes just ridiculous. feel no excuse especially saturday brunch when should properly staffed. Other then restaurant great server pleasant. back husband fell love burger skinny fries! 

Little tip all craft beer lovers epic list! Super excited new gastropub near me! Vegas needs down gastropubs open more. 

First off structure itself really awesome. patio decor vibes. 
They excellent craft brew selection food excellent. No complaints that!

The only thing service. really struggled giving place 4 stars but 3 because waiter horrible. He super nice but he literally never checked kept forgetting drinks. kept having ask other waiters them us. don't think area but still he wasn't busy. Sunday night 8 didn't leave until 10 because took forever anything.  huge downer.

For beer Dawn Red. amazing. hoppier amber fruit notes. now favorites. 

Food Fiery Calamari very good fried perfectly. wasn't spicy all though.
Shrimp Grits super tasty. grits more grits cake much ton flavor. sauce very rich spicy. 
Beef short rib parmesan mashed potatoes very good au jus gravy very rich. 
The NUTELLA COOKIE SANDWICH. going 100% honest. dessert person. But when saw cookie Yelp decided solely purpose. friends did disappoint. best cookie ice cream dessert ever life. cookie all gooey soft. perfect. 

Overall loved place. saw other servers being super tentative tables. just super unlucky. would love again soon try other dishes other yummy beers. PS702 hosted group dinner participants class running company.  used beautiful outdoor dining private space loved playing jumbo sized Jenga Connect4 food WONDERFUL!  Apps fixed price menu well received guests something everyone including vegetarians.  But most all Victoria whose name bigger she powerhouse server! She friendly attentive accurate accommodating. Great time all last night!  Thank Victoria PS702! Great experience fantastic food! sat outside enjoyed view. Super low key loud all. staff really attentive great recommendations. bad restaurant. customer service great. service great. food meh ..... Naked wing bacon cheese tator tots ok. lots sea salt them. love seasonings but tad bit salty. would back try something different. Service excellent food delicious. Def back soon recess. awesome gastropub! yesterday date night disappointed! little bit wait if wanted actual table but wasn't long Saturday night else expect. waiter great. He very helpful suggestions food beer. He also let know specials offer throughout week. ordered kale Caesar salad bangers mash bison burger. Everything fantastic! fiancé enjoyed beers well. service also very quick but didn't feel rushed anything.    also loved atmosphere decor. would definitely come back here. can't wait try rest menu. upsetting! PS702 family friendly rude waiter bad service reluctant serve people children burnt sliders RAW chicken. much else say....we going since 2nd day opened. dozens times without kids twice family both times bad which more indication don't want serve families. Food amassing. 
Atmosphere totaly unique. 
Food beer specials totally affordable. 
I found more guess ill try them all.
Deserts worlds best.
Thank Chef Ramon Castro. None entree items actually sound enticing... They're over priced flavors meh. Gave two tries same impression both times. theme restaurant most interesting thing it. place truly amazing.  concept fun but food actually incredible original.  friend very picky she loved everything.   pepper dish km particular she actually came home tried make. coming back sure! came Wednesday night watching movie. perhaps second third time Downtown Summerlin. I just recently moved northwest town south side. definitely much better atmosphere here. Back matters drinks definitely seemed more appealing food menu. Most options bacon bits being don't eat pork made annoying. ended getting Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower Irish Stout Braised Short Rib share. definitely recommended both try!!  full flavor great portion size. 

Im really big customer service new spot definitely feel staff waitress particular wasn't very attentive discussing best try lacked knowledge menu. took 20 minutes check. 

Overall cool might visit again patio experience. brunch very pleasant atmosphere over looking summerlin shopping area .
The place clean great theme going really did look school.
There's lots drinking games fun would awesome pre drinking area although Sunday did bottomless mimosas didn't look appealing hadn't quite crated right atmosphere raging good Sunday sesh.
The food good shorty bowl potatoe crunch thing which great short rib.
I can't remember name burger however good ketchup awesome.
All round price theme place going its worth 5 stars. gone brunch 2 occasions both times simply wonderful. ordered chicken sausage grits just bottomless mimosas. First off grits heaven mouth. Crispy outside soft perfect texture inside. alone made want come back more. Secondly mimosas delicious. brunch actually several drinks options choose mimosas beermosas bloody Mary's michelada 4 them any combination you'd just $10 which say more plenty! staff friendly both occasions atmosphere great socializing. also TV's those people want football fix. Came happy hour work some coworkers impressed. asked table all happy hour seatings taken sit outside hot humidity. table originally sat broken fan all other booths fans taken... Luckily move since more people join originally planned.

The food alright. wasn't best beer selection okay. wouldn't recommend place happy hour event. Josh in Guinness hat circa 2009 OK...

But cauliflower decent. Wish ranch Josh suggested Wolfgang Puck instead great place come hang especially during happy hour. great selection beers you'll hard time finding anywhere else Las Vegas. Check them out! definitely pleased encountered Chef Shea he encouraged give location another chance couple bad visits.

On recent visit immediately greet Victoria fantastic smile energetic personality definite plus hostess significant improvement over prior staff choices.

We ordered several items please each. hope corporate allow menu changed more accommodating variety tastes allow chefs perform should!

Please add STEVIA sweeteners!

Jane manager visit significant improvement over prior managers. She should GM handle customer interactions.This location great spot Downtown Summerlin some impressive indoor outdoor seating include USB outlets some tables charging devices.

The restrooms very spacious clean staff super friendly energetic. location really needed management change am glad see happening. great place night town.
Great atmosphere. Inside little loud large group had. could hear across table. Outside when weather nice would great. beer pong jenga etc.. Tvs outside watch sports great small bar outside hidden back..
Will back nighttime drinks patio. WORST EXPERIENCE DINING EVER HAD. 

I've time before reluctant try another dish friend mine had. first experience food isn't great price does fit quality most dishes. However truffled steak macaroni big hit felt only reason come. server at time big sweetheart another reason why wanted share restaurant personal friends family.

Well today mother's birthday. Knowing steak great excited bring try since she's already tried several yummy steakhouses Fogo de Chao just below plus overall presentation restaurant extremely creative! Which ONLY reason why would give place star. 

I proceed woman red hair kind reminded Ronald McDonald quickly frowns fake smile once turn in. Ultimately ignored didn't care let gesture ruin night. proceed say 2 balcony please. She leads right away offers any seat house aware servers here.

10 minutes later server came. point losing patience. Several server acknowledges us. enough time conversation reserve dinner fogo de chau ultimately ashamed brought mother here. Being sweet woman she she agreed should just leave. only did place ruin birthday dinner but rude every single way. becoming any longer. 

On side note maybe if she apologized when she clearly saw leaving might reconsidered whole situation but she instead rudely smirked left. really wish could give Public School better review. menu beer selection good some unique items but end day just another Yardhouse BJs etc. Vegas million places already really didn't stand any significant way. theme decor pretty cool though bit different spin things. shrimp grits tasty portion decent size. wife Chicken Waffles large portion very good. Father in law jalapeno pepperoni pizza he liked mom in law fish chips...they looked nice she said OK.  good. Now time bad.

Service OK but great. busy Friday night but still...not best. meal really wasn't very hot considering being served skillet bet sitting under heat lamp few minutes. just hot enough eat cold enough tow warrant sending back but should hotter. While decent selection brews prices really high getting. Once start charging $9+ pint  getting bit obnoxious regardless kind micro brew came from. 

All insignificant though comparison noise. Let clear possible. place FUCKING LOUD!!! Metallica concerts weren't loud eating place. Seriously if planning having any form conversation during your meal need bring bullhorn set volume sucker 11. If planning having conversation ear plugs should mandatory. When all left felt pleasant just hear little silence few minutes. noise alone reason none would ever return case missed first time place FUCKING LOUD INSIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok trendy theme but horribly slow service even busy. Food bland. Ordered pizza blah. husband ordered flat iron steak medium rare but horrible burnt flavor. sure happened. Waiting check still can't second beer. Urgh won't back place cute outside but broken inside service amazing Mac Cheese melted your mouth. If your looking great friendly environment bring your family lunch spot Downtown Summerlin. So....I mixed feelings place. Let's start cocktails! ordered Yellow Smoke which really good. If into spicy  cocktails love it. also gladnof Sangiovese which really nice. Next apps ordered Bacon Cheddar Tots Buffalo  Cauliflower. Both pretty tasty but prefered cauliflower. Siracha ketchup tots amazing but again enjoy spicy. **PERFECT BITE ALERT** Cauliflower blue cheese aoli hot sauce top #yummy. also tried bit friends Watermelon Tomato Salad AMAZING!

 entree ordered Flat Iron steak Chorizo Mac n Cheese. steak really good could cut butter knife. Mac N Cheese good all but am Mac N Cheese snob. just lacked flavor me...a dash salt pepper would great.

 Service really hit miss. took some time drinks bartender making drinks entire patio. server cool only issue he seemed linger talk little much me. He busy telling life story hard time asking more water placing order. other tables little frustrated well he very over dramatic. 

Overall would give place another try but hasn't made favorites list yet. tried place 3 times don't know going it.  limited menu mostly kale based.  service great if want eat your hands sit patio .  Now maybe different if going drink hang out.... visited twice girlfriend. first time decent experience don't remember having any complaints.

We revisited place July 2nd 2016 around 7 pm.. wanted outside table told 15 minute wait would text when table ready. finally texted around 20 minutes later seated outside. first hostess tried seat only table broken fan when over 100 degrees outside! bringing attention seated table working fan.

We sat table 20 minutes. No came take drink orders. No asked if needed help. waitress made eye contact 3 times didn't say anything. 

We ended leaving going Wolfgang Puck next door which excellent way.

I would recommend place based non existent service. Public School 702 very unique restaurant bar.  absolutely  love   theme decor restaurant which embodies whole school theme.  only imagine  happpy hours  here.

The food selection restaurant  very typical burgers pizza fries course  drinks.  brunch menu contains limited number breakfast items however chicken waffles  good.  also enjoyed endless well almost endless  styles mimosas.  Overall fun exciting  restaurant bar  hangout at. Good place. Good potential. Still shaking off opening jitters. Wait staff could use some bussers focus customers but food drinks good. Can't wait come back when they've time settle in! looking somewhere new eat birthday found place online. Came found myself love experience being 'school'. Bookshelves books world maps amazing solar system lighting piece chalkboards list on..The menu 'notebook' loved it. specialty drinks listed college ruled paper small clipboard. Definitely school like atmosphere. started tater tots sriracha ketchup bomb!! ahi tacos tasted little acidic then order steak salad steak perfectly cooked though salad itself little oily taste. Couldn't tell if drooling if salad oil dripping but overall good. colleague ordered Adobo taco cilantro lime rice I should've ordered crazy delicious then sampled few brews before deciding wanted. waitress amazing though admit service bit slower. slowed ordered main dishes appetizers came fairly quickly can't blame waitress likely issue kitchen weren't many diners served 30 35 minutes the drinks did hold down enough barely notice time . Since bit rush end meal asked deserts which came find ALWAYS includes ice cream waitress kindly offered gift card instead. happy definitely come back recess. food alright but customer service horrible serve time ridiculous. Hidden place no host food quality dry no flavor. recommend restaurant maybe ok bar side but need upbeat bartenders. Sad say but place won't last long husband FEAST Public School 702 Monday evening during happy hour. Happy Hour specials available bar area outside patio Mon Fri 3 30PM 6 30PM. ended patio nice view Downtown Summerlin. thanking lucky stars stumbled just time Recess .

Come hang weekends. late lunch Wednesday. Service excellent. BBQ Bison Burger authentic char broiler taste just touch sweet bbq sauce emmental cheese. Wild Mushroom Taleggio Pizza bold earthy mushroom taste. Fries served Sriracha ketchup. Besides regular tap beers rotating list twelve fifteen first rate drafts. saw pictures mythical dessert called Nutella Cookie Sandwich. week imagining could possibly taste feel until finally decided try it.

By entrance glass display sports trophies Pom poms Michael Jordan lunchbox algebra book calculus book all things would remind school minus nun smacks your hand ruler because Public School 702. just budget cuts.

The menu would remind notebook napkins would remind notepad. Blackboards wall moon planets above your head. Hipsters glasses beards sleeve tats beer. 90's hip hop playing background.

We tried grilled salmon bison burger chicken waffles Nutella Cookie Sandwich. entrees just ok. bison burger nice spicy kick but also almost anaphylactic reaction because ingredient wasn't menu description but somehow burger. fries great.

The Nutella Cookie Sandwich would only reason I'd come back here. chocolate chip cookies Nutella schmeared flat side cookies vanilla ice cream middle wall bacon brittle. 5 ...yup only $5  big enough 2 3 people.

The service could use remedial lessons. six top 6 30 reservation table four chairs looking into setting sun.  Youser! Two employees said sorry but nothing fixed.  metal chairs worst chairs ever history restaurants owee.  service c best person table school no pun intended server beer selection.  Once all meals ordered did two appetizers cauliflower tots.  Tots great cali good.  tots came 30 seconds prior first dinner plates.  say all food hot mostly warm.  good.  food tasted good presentation good well.  ordered giant cookie desert plate six us????

LOVE place. crushed velvet cocktail absolutely delicious. theme adorable menus being composition notebooks take bags saying homework them. already eaten twice last couple weeks. Love love LOVE place. Love location menu. Giving 4 stars because sorority alumni group specifically asked separate checks multiple times before during ordering but waiter epically  failed ! Edamame hummus flatbread amazing buffalo cauliflower ! Lunch amazing.  Excellent choice options perfect portions great draft beers rotational selections highly recommended place! Came lunch salmon ... Actually attempting eat now am writing review. food taste horrible portion size enough feed small 5 year old child incredibly small. lunch menu consists 30 items none which appetizing. Additionally requested straw wouldn't put lips glass water brought cocktail stir stick straw. would AVOID place plague if deciding come lunch perhaps dinner better but won't coming back find out. letting family friends know disappointment place should avoid it. eat California Pizza kitchen even Wolf gang Puck instead slightly better portion size better food . Disappointed leaving place still hungry ... girlfriend ordered fish chips didn't even finish meal she stated she wasn't slightest impressed food service. lucky enough attend soft opening dinner invitation which offered amazing selection dishes enjoy. started off Moscow Mule a MUST HAVE enjoyed cheese meats appetizer which good. girlfriend enjoyed asian Salmon dish while skirt steak medium well. tell salmon world perfectly cooked nice seasoned outside flaky scrumptious inside. stake bit cold but flavor good. All all place great food drinks any occasion especially when looking off work blow off some steam!

With ample space large screen TVs great customer service central location inside Downtown Summerlin place must visit! favorite restaurant Downtown Summerlin Wild Mushroom pizza good Moody burger great too. Outside seating nice during fall winter wish restaurant taller but view still nice. Good kids well! Menu looked promising ambiance decor definitely cool but food extremely average. PB J Burger Chorizo Mac Cheese Nutella Cookie dessert. All sounded great but poorly executed. wouldn't recommend place come back. used come regularly three times every two weeks. while due revisit. Well bad idea come tonight.  walked 5 35 far being busy. fact eight guests bar best. tables all 10 guests spread out. ratio staff guests equal. 5 52 realized invisible. server acknowledged seated right smack middle entire common area centered tv screen. walked hostess brilliant intuition  not! said Would server? speechless.

Highly recommended! visited lazy dog cafe best service Drea she fast efficient funny! Good atmosphere decor pretty cool. Decent beer selection if you're into that. Bad food. chorizo mac cheese app. Noodles hard. aldente. Hard. sauce very thin chorizo unevenly distributed big chunks. pepperoni pizza meal very disappointed.  hard mess pizza but came pretty close. tasted cafeteria pizza but cost substantially more. price whole meal displeased. Would only visit again grab drink. twice when hanging DTS Downtown Summerlin love vibe!

Service service good both times here. always fastest but servers friendly happy oblige.

Food love buffalo cauliflower burgers shrimp grits DIE for! 'cake' grits amazing blend shrimp kale sauteed sauce top it.

Sometimes food hit miss honest didn't pictures brunch toast fried chicken sandwich but fun spot anytime day great beer selection. needed place could accommodate diverse family eight some diversity food drink. problem places Public School Yard House etc they're just generic. food decent fare probably 3 1 2. Service solid lunch pretty happy. restaurant very new. matter fact believe opened two days ago. mind know little early criticizing restaurant.  When restaurant two girls battled over Seat us. Once seated waited. then continued wait. waited some more. wife actually played game where would see many waiters waitresses would pass look directly.  10 minutes just sitting told wife if more waiter walks would leave. wife extremely embarrassed but put foot down. Shortly two waiters walked right past talked each other. walk out. walked restaurant both laughed. only did nobody notice leaving but greeter just seated actually said thank nice day. know restaurant fairly new won't talk food drink. Oh yeah never point. sure if would ever back place. just weird situation honest. Doesn't restaurant want serve food drink its customers? Apparently public school 702 . Yeah.. food great all but... would ordered more drinks Mindy just stopped talking boys next gave little more attention. $70 bill would turned into lot more.. going Yard House now.. oh well.

Amazing customer service.  beautiful delicious morning.   told server surprise host patient when asked move patio.   chicken waffle breakfast bottomless mimosas happy asked Lacey surprise me.   Can't wait come back support place again Good great. Nice selection beers service good although server quiet talker could barely hear over din.   right quiet spot. Nice decor though cute keeping school theme.
Ordered crispy ahi tacos which could used bit more acid pinch salt but overall tasty
Bacon cheddar tater tots really tasty
Buffalo cauliflower good hitch.  larger pieces cauliflower uncooked batter nooks crannies.  bit turn off.
Fish chips tasty but really greasy well.  wife took all cocktail napkins table soak oil all soaked. 
I ordered huntsman burger which server recommended order medium.  opted medium rare personal preference .  Burger came medium.  bit disappointed but  deal killer.

Some minor hiccups probably give them another shot but if still mediocre may last time.  If place bills itself gastropub expect some innovative food.  case today.  Time tell. Aurelia excellent server! Always checking making sure taken care of! She best server ever here! Everyone should definitely request when come here! A+++++++++++++ family some free time Monday night heard happy hour well worth visit! ended beer pong tables outside winter season Jane always made sure check even turned heaters outside sure comfortable. Amazing food amazing service  we'll back forsure Very interesting unique concept. food all made scratch very yummy. place big but very loud. mixed crowd but very young crowd if school. Service could better. return few months try other dishes. Came brunch Saturday some girls. tell food pretty good. Although little pricey .  smothered breakfast burrito really good. Just kind expensive literally burrito nothing else. Also partook almost bottomless mimosas which purchase any entree $10. Almost gets 4 drinks . mix match drinks beermosa michelada Bloody Mary. 


I'd def come back because service excellent food good well. stopped brunch very yummy. Super awesome veggie hash sweet looking chicken waffles amazing buffalo cauliflower very cool atmosphere take back your school daze. selection local craft beers fabulous ones tried Pilsner Belgian wit very tasty.

All say WOW!!! Awesome food. Great service. beer selection variety SWEET!! Delicious food. Don't pass place up. Unique food unbelievable flavors. definitely your favorites list. Great decor waitress very attentive  three stars.  Food boring.  Frito dish suppose chili over Fritos cheese pickled  jalapeños.  just taco meat over Fritos little cheese cream sauce.  Very dry uninspired.   Sliders tiny dry burger rounds oversized buns.   Chorizo Mac Cheese excellent. food okay. But nothing special. When lunch very rude disrespectful man serving us. When asked question he responded very mean tone acted should already know answer. Then he judged eating. Both table noticed he talking colleagues pointing laughing. felt very disrespected. loved vibe  place gave off when ate before but he made feel un welcome. never bar where pay before drink service ok 5 Bartenders running 200 people appetizer very hard explain first experience never again !!! first time today during lunch.  Timing must right because crowded all.  Beer selection pretty good...both tap bottle.  opted Golden Monkey boyfriend Peanut Butter Milk Stout which he loved.  

Ordered Ahi Tuna Poke first appetizer.  Yummy!!!
The Eggs Benedict pizza enough two people.  delicious flavorful!   ham roasted brussel sprouts cheese fried eggs placed top.  

Marilyn server very nice took great care us.  can't wait back. came day Christmas expected service little slow. didn't expect almost non existent complaints met rudeness.

After waiting almost 45 minutes still even receiving drinks spoke server wait. He then said clearly annoyed he many tables wait pointing each table he no help. No apology wait just excuses. told while regrettable understaffed responsibility management deal  ultimately problem. He responded well problem if things little slower you'd them be. point done. asked speak manager waited ANOTHER 15 minutes before walking out. He never appeared. 

There many other options area anyone put such abysmal service. Tried place twice. fan. girls seat snooty. food alright but nothing compared all options DT Summerlin.

Now look wise place cool. interior table settings all school themed. Cute idea. Would ideal place someone wanting try wide variety beers. being beer drinker myself found myself little options. cocktails okay but nothing would order again. If big beer fan definitely check place out. Julian awesome! rare find servers your day. Great beer selections solid crowd turn Sunday Funday! searching yelp visit Las Vegas during sema show found gem restaurant glad did. place awesome looking inside out. staff super friendly seated right away. food really good selection wasn't normal stuff all other places have. If you're ever Vegas look place up. wish South Florida. Keep good work 702! live Summerlin Public School several times. located second floor nice outdoor patio. Drinks good especially berry mule lot beers try. Favorite apps chorizo Mac cheese buffalo cauliflower.  Steak tacos good. Carrot slaw spicy but delicious. Pepperoni pizza spicy favorites.  friends raved chicken sandwich shrimp grits but personally haven't tried them yet. 
One favorite places eat! Mom decided try new restaurants Downtown Summerlin.  looked cool place decided eat here.  place decorated school books solar system.  Very cute concept.  Seems would fun place night hanging bar.

We started diet cokes.  brought very small bottles.  sure if means pay refills.  Colorado Lamb Burger tomato cranberry jam arugula brie brioche bun I held bun wrapped lettuce instead .  burger nice cooked.  Looked brie cranberry jam arugula.  Yum!  Mom fish chips.  She asked cocktail sauce which don't normally serve but made her.  Fish crispy outside flaky instead.  Good flavor.  Mom loved fries. 

We good service friendly waitress. Definitely cut place.  am sure back some point. view outdoor patio great! shrimp grits delicious! shared plates average size calamari bacon tots good. Service point. Prices little steep but given location  expected. Casual atmosphere. Cute little spot Downtown Summerlin but food drinks disappointing. Cauliflower dish tasty but all burgers pretty mushy unflavorful. super disappointed drink well. tasted syrup old ice. Service also pretty slow considering three tables there. shopping around all day looking quick bite eat. heard lot cool things place decided give try. walked told its happy hour. Score! 
Happy hour Monday Thursday 3 30 6 30. Happy hour isn't everywhere but just bar bar area. originally sat lot table middle bar but moved over booth once cleaned. food pretty good service just ok. server didn't say more 10 words whole hour half there. understand happy hour but when didn't look terribly busy?? She didn't ask why switched tables. She didn't ask if food tasting ok. She said most when she dropped off tab. 

Pros chargers under bar happy hour prices each table bar area laid back cool atmosphere menus composition notebooks super clever! wifi cute little bookshelves math cards all around really feel school atmosphere outdoor seating looking over downtown summerlin outdoor seating fans everywhere.. Also life size connect four 

Cons waitress did seem she huge hurry when first sat down despite restaurant looking busy 


Tip*** wifi name under public school password public school

Happy hour food highly recommend ahi poke delicious!! Also fried cauliflower buffalo sauce very good. red quinoa salad personal favorite. 

Would back? Overall would back try some more things. food pretty good. service bit lacking but would again Lovely dinner deck overlooking Summerlin downtown. still love Calamari spicy cauliflower appetizers. wonderful tequila cocktail salad noodles shrimp. guests fried fish lamb bolognese. relaxing lovely dining atmosphere no loud music thank goodness. could hear guests across table. Inside noisier always choose patio deck! check new cool place like Yard House but better atmosphere. service bar very attentive lunch time. chicken sandwich crispy lots good stuff inside. Overall would return. Another great experience feel obligated review now.  Connor bartender server he super engaging.  Knowledge attentive but all forced.  chicken salad suggestion thoroughly enjoyed.  Great vibe staff menu.  Check out! Accommodating special diet request but service very slow felt over priced salad... But flavor profiles good. Expected more. gastropub scene craft brews tricked Mac cheeses getting quickly saturated fiercely competitive leaving grasping differentiators accurately recall where dined night before. 
 beer itself won't anymore nor quirky bacon wrapped jammed fare. 
 upstairs patio set Public School nice atmosphere reminiscent Southern California good job there. 
 beer selection doesn't hurt either. 
 Food rather predictable though still delicious interesting look at. 
 decided throw caution wind lamb burger laden delicious fatty juicy calories minus bun plus quinoa salad. While delicious fat made burger...delicious quinoa salad very meh. better? No? come house feed you. 
 gripe. Yes group 22. Yes PIA. But did reservation. ok can't put tables together fine three adjacent tables totally cool. But two waiters working two VERY different speeds different schedules completely independently each other except coordinating bill. is while just putting order coworkers other table getting food delivered. bit extreme if ask. wait stare down while tuck napkins into collars. 
 Otherwise everything seamlessly. No special urge back. Yay am fan PS702!  reliable spot food shared plates entrees.  If want beer large selection those too. 

Favorites FOR TABLE Bacon Cheddar Tots Sriracha Ketchup Speck Eggs Chorizo Mac n Cheese ENTREE Shrimp White Cheddar Grits SALAD just Roasted Chicken Quinoa Salad arugula feta avocado tomatoes red onions walnuts champagne vinaigrette.  nice balance protein greens dressing isn't heavy feel good yourself eating it.  feeling might away if eat gelato afterwards but still salad good you.

If you're Downtown Summerlin try recess here. Public school 702 overall dining experience call great together place friends. bar prett cozy. place located downtown summerlin. tried many varieties food Poké tacos caught taste buds. gave complimentary pazookie mistake which highly appreciated. all guys trying good social time come public house 702. Great brunch just grab drink bring big crowd. Plenty keep entertained good little view patio. service always great mac cheese must must must. love love watermelon heirloom tomato salad great short ribs fabulous come back bangers mash! Thank Public School staff great night out!!!!! love place much pains only able give 3 stars. food always amazing but service spotty no matter time day come. Tonight's dinner took 3 hours 2 people apps entree share dessert!!! Why does always take long serve acknowledge table once seated? usually just spirals there. night missing appetizer remind server about. finally showed end meal. If wasn't awesome pizza BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER would never come back. Sometimes meal worth sitting thru bad service for. Simply amazing. sat outside beautiful day. ordered Thyme Thyme cosmo couldn't enough! Although could tell which bartender made which drink. only 2 bartenders. first drink made female...first pink squeezed lemon frothy thyme...the second time different color pink no froth no thyme lemon. When asked new asked if male made second waitress said yes...so asked if female could I'd patiently wait it. Matt old fashion also made girl. second came back completely different color. Before waitress sat down she mentioned looked different also didn't cherry second time around. conclusion food great! deviled eggs amazing! I'd back again! passed place several times but never stopped before. Thursday evening joined some friends HH. Upon arriving place much larger expected. Plenty seating bar area restaurant plenty tables well. bar area extends outside some comfortable booths tables. such beautiful evening elected sit outside. patio overlooks part Downtown Summerlin darker became prettier view became.

Upon being seated greeted quickly server. decided take advantage HH deals. ordered cauliflower buffalo wings cheeseburger sliders margarita pizza Italian meatballs. friends both ordered Tangerine Dream beer Pacific Ale Ballast Brewery San Diego. server super attentive helpful. food arrived quickly hot. All devoured cauliflower buffalo wings. never before but really liked them. meatballs sliders also tasty. passed pizza but informed delicious. 

All all really enjoyed time restaurant. Service remarkable very customer friendly. anticipate returning enjoy full lunch dinner future. amazing place. atmosphere staff food! definitely come back.  Thank accommodating large group! blast Public School 702 favorite spots since first tried it. Recently wife lunch 2 20. ordered cheeseburger medium rare usual. third time ordered it. When arrived nowhere near medium rare closer well done. thought well some siracha ketchup should fine long still tastes good. Second bite charcoal. inspected totally burnt outside even cheese top burn spots! seriously first time sent food back. waitress very sweet apologetic said cook another right away. 10 min later second burger shows up. Still medium rare but least wasn't burnt. didn't want wait another 10 15 min start eating. finished burger paid left. credit did take burger check. But I'd rather pay delicious burger came meh free. 

Was really bummed started love place. still try again but definitely making trip it. Think Yard House but school theme better food more limited drink menu. 

LOCATION ATMOSPHERE
Located Downtown Summerlin's little circle restaurants random rock formation fountain Public School 702 gives off perfect local hangout vibe. always poppin' every time been. restaurant itself very large really stick schoolhouse vibe the menus super cute composite notebooks! . 

It's obvious Public School 702 recent addition already successful chain restaurants. love each location unique its area code including menus.

SERVICE
If service amazing place would definitely 5 5 book. very unorganized since employees dressed casually sometimes difficult tell who. addition some them friendliest people sometimes feel burdening them when keep having attention.

However some servers super friendly above beyond. really hit miss here. cool thing samples any drinks! bring little shot glass beer try things out.

FOOD DRINK
Two words CUTTING. BOARD.

I don't know why obsessed but Cutting Board $14 appetizer charcuterie plate just bomb me! combination delicious cured meats cheese thin crispy bread. meld together well! Also love onion capers. worth.

Also AHI TUNA TACOS amazing. never liked those kind newfangled tacos stick adobada tripa thank you but perfect amount freshness delicate fish thin crisp. just melts your mouth! $10 gets 4 tacos.

I couple other dishes but none them really made impression. drinks only tried few craft beers menu. Campfire Stout alright but happy see carried Ninkasi Dawn Red. 

The bill little costly depending your appetite food alcohol but sometimes worth splurge especially if sit balcony nice evening. yet hit happy hour but definitely come back soon! general really enjoy far PBS. 

The first time 11 19 15 bogged down shopping bags alone. remembered all reviews mentioning crispy cauliflower decided try it. came HH seated bar. Although alone bartender pleasant chatty without being intrusive. liked that. HH portion cauliflower $5 tuna tacos $7. also incredible beer 2 Stone 's Sorry Sorry suggested bartender. Honestly drinker Yelpers events attest but beer fantastic as should $8. The second time few days later again crispy cauliflower. regular portion much larger HH size price fair. Brian P. also ordered mashed potatoes just snack full meal potatoes taking really long time come us. When mentioned waitress still hadn't received potatoes she check kitchen. kitchen told already aware hadn't received potatoes made them already but weren't par. Because snafu cook remaking order without even asking she told wouldn't billed potatoes.  good customer service. Thankfully potatoes piping hot delicious. 

While only gripe entrees pretty pricey casual bar type place general really enjoyed PBS. love theme food service. back! came brunch sat outside. Waited 5 minutes waters spent another 10 minutes waiting someone take order drinks. finally getting tired waiting bar ordered drinks. would given them 1 star but saved them bartenders which all nice 10 dollar bottomless mimosas brunch. Other bartenders specials everything else bad. try place again few weeks. Hopefully better. Service horrible. 10 minutes waiter's attention order. 20 minutes 4 requests napkins flatware no avail. Finally bar back. Waiter never checked us. Would liked order second drink but waiter never around. Only if want treated poorly. Love place games outside cool mini shuffleboard.

Service Friendly attentive.

Ambiance Very cool decor wood floors metal chairs. 

Location 2nd floor Downtown Summerlin. first time happy hour wife brother sister in law. venues really cool location Summerlin marketplace. Right above Fogo day ciao

The vibe really cool music playing alternative mix top 40 some old school 90s tunes. name Decour totally match you walk feel you're science lab library chalkboards comfortable seating. bar communal seating very long tables 10 12 stools side.  would coin bar sports bar only TV bar could see if want watch basketball games you'll someplace else. sat bar only five minutes before even ordered drinks because going allow happy hour outdoor patio which delightful great atmosphere noisy inside weather warm helpful service.

The first look menus notebooks would see college small clipboard well happy hour menu. happy hour menu 8 10 food options along some wine beer.  also well drink specials to.

I tried just everything appetizer menu disappointed ahi poke bland PB J sliders wasn't explained actually hamburger slider peanut butter jelly just didn't together tables liking. wife loves pizza she ordered margarita pizza which didn't enough cheese it. pizza sauce little spicy which both wife like. huge hummus fan excited try white bean hummus know really OK needed little salt increase flavor just tasted flat. 

There no salt and pepper tables try hold waiter Brandon wasn't fault. wanted tell Brandon appetizers mediocre best return pb j sliders but good Friday didn't want picky thankful but 6 appetizers stood out. Oh   true did try fried cauliflower which probably most appetizing appetizer.  service very good leave water bottle your table don't keep asking waiter every time fill water glass cup really that.

I wouldn't back any food if happy hour appetizers boring wouldn't expect food any better. would back drink glass wine wife no food brewery across street redrock Casino far better appetizers 10 times amount choices. 

Right before party four left quick stop bathroom came did see chalkboards talking specials know few errors probably being picky but said beers $4 7 didn't see any beers menu $4 management should update signage properly address happy hour menu says. Just checked new Downtown Summerlin spot.  would highly recommend it!  very cool vibe service very friendly food excellent!

Pros Food great!  Service friendly outside area very nice

Cons Inside VERY loud few beers tap Overall very well done definately place would back to! Sitting patio feel vacay! 
Great views relaxing vibe beautiful marble tabletops good service food. 
I always buffalo cauliflower because good served side bleu cheese buffalo sauce. Side note ranch all. Which good thing think. 
On visit just few apps all reasonably priced drinks. 
Great spot come downtown Summerlin where walk around shop bite delightful experience. Great place watch games. Lots tv plenty room. Good brew selection bar food bad. would given them 5 star if kept things consistent. Sometimes fries perfect sometimes soggy. When  switch brew sometimes don't clean line which really bad if don't sour. Big plus staff. service place fantastic! 


T would enjoy hanging bar. dinner last Friday 6 others. Nice place. Poor service. sat outside. server screwed 2 orders. would second drink but never asked if wanted another. never asked food would sent back because wrong. Tried American Burger. Nothing special just your standard typical burger you'd find any ole restaurant. Fries lacking soggy. Hubby crispy chicken sandwich w kale salad. If blue cheese salad. If overpowers salad. Hubby's sandwich decent spicy flavor but nothing special. Also tried ahi tuna tacos start. dressing nice tart but would prefer salad flavor ahi. ahi itself being raw bit fishy w no flavor other its fishiness.  Downtown Summerlin but Im interested coming back Public School 702. drinks friend cool concept! live music outside inside looks walked into your high school! specialty cocktails very yummy! Especially version Moscow mule!!! food good but issue restaurant. bills itself scratch gastro Pub. First scratch store bought bloody Mary mix so easy scratch . bar Brandy can't Pina Colada toasted almond blue martini doesn't carry decaf coffee had down stairs Crave restaurant cup decaf bring back decaf Bailey's . Yellow thunder very good.

All aside Chicken waffles excellent steak salad. cheese bacon tater tots also good. favorite mac cheese Chorizo. cookie ice cream sandwich Nutella bacon brittle outside kind gross. husband shopping daughter mother Summerlin. heard rave reviews place through few co workers Wynn. decided try establishment two year old. Fingers crossed It perfect! Even kid's meal presentation point. steak salad hubby fish chips. Very good. Ambiance loud but just enough drown fun she having. 

We looking forward going back week little date night. menu great amount options decor well thought out. Food very fresh. 

Hoping restaurant opens another location soon!!! Please check out. Well worth money. service extremely slow. took 10 minutes greet when say down. took 45 minutes arrival meal. food high quality.  told waiter steak salad romaine lettuce radish balsamic vinaigrette. came arugula radish tasty vinaigrette. impressed food service. Good food. Loud tho hope da food tha same. wife drinkin beer lol food beyond expectation far Christina took very good care us. ordered all items she highly recommended amazing. food guavalajara drink just heavenly! Great food great vibe! Thank very much!! Decided check again blown away. Atmosphere awesome again. service amazing. Extremely kind hostess Victoria waitress Sarah . food good. Ordered new things now new favorite appetizers! fried buffalo cauliflower bacon cheddar tots. good! inside restaurant nice clean. Outside chill some games play even sit watch sporting event tv's hang out. definitely place come more often. Pretty excited discover Cali gastropub arriving swanky Downtown Summerlin. Great beers server only fun but extremely knowledgeable turned whimsical tasty Golden Monkey. Outdoor patio great place late night meal. best al locals half off bill Mondays. good that? very impressed place just opening up! Husband seated immediately waitress Christina came over shortly after. She wonderful right away she told all place pointed some favorite options which always pleased when just most expensive. Also liked 6 dishes made vegetarian request. 

We started buffalo cauliflower suggestion which amazing am fan cauliflower. served blue cheese aioli Frank's red hot sauce side. large portion two would again! 

Also ahi tuna wonton tacos. good. amazing but good. don't think would them again though since cauliflower left such big impression. 

For dinner shrimp grits beer blanc sauce. perfect!!!! would order again. shrimp cut half looks getting more think are. didn't mind because cutting shrimp smaller pieces some every bite. lady sitting next ordered she recommended but said bit spicy her. enjoyed bit heat dish didn't feel all spicy. enjoyed just smashing mixing everything together would little everything every bite. portion large enough take some lunch tomorrow which liked. 

Husband fried jidori chicken green chili  cornbread waffles bacon red eye gravy side. He ate faster ever seen eat before! He LOVED he said waffle nice savory accompaniment fried jidori chicken. able sneak bite chicken most juiciest moist chicken long time VERY delicious. best tasting chicken long time creamy yet firm best chicken flavor ever had! 


The atmosphere very hip all types decorations classroom. ceiling over bar looked gymnasium floor beer pong jenga table shuffle board darts. patio beautiful reminds nice back yard cool seating options. Each cabana table own personal fan summer heater when cooler. variety seating options anywhere two toppers larger parties which liked because seems wouldn't wait long tables pushed together parties 6 more round tables larger parties which like.  

This definitely new to. can't wait try rest menu everything looked scrumptious. Decided drop lunch day because its new many friends tried out. Rolled around 2 30 pm wasn't busy. No hostess front table just wandered over bar area. Sat down looked over bar which loaded plenty beers some interesting alcohol selections well.

Christina bartender came over greeted smile explained few selections more featured beer menu which changes weekly. chose nice Citrus y IPA looked over menu some food.

This where lose some stars because read menu several times looking something would pique interest but really wasn't anything screamed Eat . ended going CCB chicken burger. decent bacon avocado cooked well. But wasn't fantastic world good. 

The two girls next sharing pizza could see slightly burnt. Didn't look all impressive. least girls pretty look at. TV's above bar seemed place really focal point bar area. Maybe place hopping during Happy Hours. huge space plenty tables outdoor patio area overlooks nice garden water feature. 

Total bill $22 beer chicken burger probably won't venture back meal but might some drinking here. decor cute idea restaurant! reason why giving three stars because feel menu very limited very standard. You're paying lot regular bar food even during happy hour! Being positive person always look good things. Positives Public School cool idea Grade A+ . Cafeteria style seating indoors but noisy Grade B outside large patio lots space enjoy Grade A . But  where ends. Service okay best Grade C yes polite positive Grade B . kitchen slowed them down served nothing would proud turn Grade D . Overall I'd give Public School  grade C . stand  Downtown Summerlin Pubic School needs take some extra credit study little harder. Great atmosphere enjoy good food appetizers drinks different genres music playing background. Clean sporty relaxed fun environment family night first date group meal etc. Excellent location just walking downtown Summerlin mall. TURN DOWN MUSIC PLEASE! night club. When round table 6 young people can't hear each other talk more annoying enjoyable. server 4 things wrong think because she couldn't hear us!!! 

The food drinks good next time eat if can't sit outside just pass. First time enjoyed bottomless mimosas  calamari entree ordered huntsman burger couscous salad everything very delicious. Great prices fun interesting restaurant definitely back. hosted small event Patio PS702 today. introduction Randy managers working Sara catering waitstaff Victoria Cody Elizabeth really impressed! Friendly efficient complete 100% pleasure working group! AWESOME place!  Great food great service!  made reservation glad did!

Got just time tail end Recess aka Happy Hour .  Decent variety drink appetizer specials enough should cover everyone's tastes.  Bartenders very knowledgeable very friendly even though PACKED.

Dinner things just better tried fried Coli flour reviewed many times.  really good but outdid bacon cheddar tater tots.  YUM!  main Bangers Mash.  Really good sausages excellent though quite true English form B M but still VERY good.  wife Roasted Pablano she's vegetarian but  would worked delicious boot!

Our friend Short Rib which he reported world good.  wife Shrimp White Cheddar grits.  Best grits ever tried.

Just wish more 5 stars really place stand even more.  back sure!! Great service. Especially Amber Lynn Francisco. Buffalo cauliflower Brussels sprouts best part meal.  Need larger size beer options. Great selection tap. mediocre first experience several months ago group friends meeting lunch joined them.  opposed last visit service very good but then restaurant did only smattering guests.

Food?  different story!  asked if Thai noodle salad chicken shrimp would enough lunch.  Server said Absolutely! Well he wrong!  usually take leftovers home me.  actually left hungry came home sandwich!  $14 thought would least small chicken breast.  only small shredded piece size little finger 2 mini pieces shrimp!  Salad bland little flavor.  also detected no cilantro. 

One friend ordered chicken breast sandwich bacon avocado.  served nice bun fries.  She said good. 

After 2 pathetic experiences probably won't back.  just many choices area.

It no surprise restaurant nearly empty during should noon rush hour. come all time work drink coworker. huge fan beer won't mention anything but fact incredibly long list different beers. prefer drink wine nice selection. gentlemen bar always willing give samples try before decide. friend usually order bottle wine single glasses no less $9 each. bottle order usually around $36 which find bit pricey but surprising seeing Downtown Summerlin. absolutely love fiery fried calamari must every time come. also ordered cutting board which comes selection cheeses meats bread great pairing wine. ordered sliders margherita pizza truffle fries... all amazing. always come sat bar area service great. Food almost always comes quickly. Things bit wild during Happy Hour. Waitresses take ages come your table takes longer food. only receive happy hour specials bar bar area fills very quickly big. don't know much service tables. love atmosphere music whole vibe here. favorite bars downtown Summerlin. only reasoning 4 stars prices. If knocked few dollars off place would perfect. food amazing. lot drinks choose from. really awesome jenga beer pong. docked major stars would give service alone 1 star. waitress karissa horrible. Sat down waited ten minutes drink orders. She forgot sons order. she took drink orders she over talks another worker five minutes then finally outside other table. understand when people busy but she talking half time seemed she could give two shits. give place another try but maybe drinks friends. 
Also weird steak but no a1 steak sauce? brought BBQ sauce??! Even fine dining steak houses chillis a1 mean come on. least busser course server she Mia courtesy bring some kind sauce husband. few times both brunch lunch much absolutely love decor ambience which all School Subject Themed food always underwhelming service somewhat subpar. 

Most waiter's seem quite friendly fairly attentive some incredibly well versed beer menu so far suggest food pairings which think pretty fun. 

In last visit received check paid Card processed over TWICE owed. Now fair accident waiter absolutely shocked happened since appeared anomaly however he took hopefully would become Voided Ticket way prove card charged twice or mis charged end if need be. 

This round ordered chicken burger brother lamb. Honestly prefer over mine appreciate quinoa substitute option over fries which come spicy ketchup good but taste bud preference. definitely preferred burger mine although liked Chicken fact ground chicken patty just strip chicken breast. 

We did arrive during Knight's Game possible food service bit backed although only front restaurant bar filled still plenty opens seats lacked TV views. brother opted sit outside beautiful day clear skies misters provided occasional dusting coolness which perfect relaxing. 

All in all just wish liked food little more wish brunch menu more exciting somehow. want LOVE Public School but there's something place just keeps falling short expectations. dinner big party weekday. Cute atmosphere FANTASTIC food great service. Connor Janelle took care very attentive. enjoyed dinner chance play some games. life size Jenga Connect Four. also corn hole beer pong. would definatly come back next trip. Thanks guys!! place awesoooooooooooome!!!! 
Cool vibe nice interior lovely outdoor patio. Came Wednesday night some girls DJ playing some awesome 90's hip hop alternating some karaoke action. 

Bacon cheddar tater tots 4 5. Everyone loved but thought good. 
Summer succotash 4 5. Good stuff but die for. First time eating succotash apparently doesn't any better this. 
Deviled eggs 3 5. Good but nothing special. 
Truffle fries 4 5 Good but better. 
Mezza plate 3 5.  waiter recommended this. didn't think hummus anything else great except fried garbanzo bean crunchy outside. 
Shrimp grits 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! Great sauce flavor shrimp perfectly cooked grits patty looks hash brown absolutely delicious. I'd come back dish hands down. 

Phenomenal selection beers available here. extra star carrying fave beer...Greenflash IPA. 
Service excellent. slow because busy but waiter Jared super helpful friendly made sure taken care though keep mind service generally slow food took while arrive. 

Kyle GM came say hello he super nice well. 
I ambiance place DJ played awesome music really made night me. Met lot cool locals. I'd definitely come back try jidori fried chicken well burgers. Kudos Jared putting ladies girls night out! great start evening.you're playing friendly game shuffleboard wait! Brittany food quality serving times poor. being kind waitress did best but food cold came all different intervals. great but more hipster night club loud music your mileage may very! Brunch options great. Relaxed atmosphere sunny terrace. Chicken sausage eggs grits very tasty. OJ fresh squeezed.
 Server attentive though. Based tried place acceptable. tried Fried Jidori Chicken Waffles PB J Burger Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. 

Fried Jidori Chicken Waffles  3 stars  fried chicken wasn't crispy over easy egg top didn't help lack crispiness. waffles weren't crispy quite soggy but some nice heat green chili. Overall found dish lackluster.

PB J  4 stars  creative twist good ole hamburger. Nice balance between nutty sweet savory each bite. Patty cooked medium requested. 1 star ding because could bigger given price.

Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower  3 stars  deep friend cauliflower some buffalo blue cheese sauces. Expected much more usually cool twist cauliflower. issue cauliflower could softer considering deep fried.

5 stars ambiance  old school bleachers wall 80's theme other retro designs. Pretty cool nice music.

Wasn't crowded Saturday brunch.

Plenty parking since anchored Downtown Summerlin mall. Just meh. Food good but nothing outstanding want return for. decor inside fantastic. loved concept location decor but just wasn't enough food being so so. Best service restaurant very long time! Waiter Matt he very Attentive.
I Eggs Benedict Pizza really good prosciutto crust buttery hot when came out.

Grandma chicken waffles tried well really good especially take waffles which made corn bread. Love corn bread fact eagle texture but still filling hardy? Perfect. Gravy chunky but still flavorful. Overall all flavored balanced well.

Uncle Lamb Burger looked good he enjoyed but said needed creamy horseradish he loves once he A1 well.

Came brunch also bottomless options. 

5 stars eyes because key thing. bathroom family walked thought they'd grab left over pizza.. half.. didn't walked back table no more 3 minutes later pizza tossed. Didn't even insist Matt way stop what's he's doing speak manager quickly inform if am no rush if could wait 5 10 new cook take home. mean wasn't gonna walk around anyways opted wait around expecting maybe half smaller version one. But gave entire pizza.. even seemed larger original one! Don't know managers name Caucasian man maybe 6'3 .. Thank nd hats off place!

Awesome decor color schemes matched tell place good simply fact slammed.. only thinks too.

100% recommend back try some those crazy percentage drafts So... everytime service amazing food always consistent amazing. live talent way loud should shout party staff serving me. Please fix this. being disrespected waitresses? If place you!! cousin ps 2 diff times  waitresses came meatballs said your meatballs didn't order meatballs . Response u turn no comment when walking correct costumer food if savage rude say Oh ok  no worries . 

Total b words waitresses but male bartender working sunday night late 30's shaved head super cool. Hence 2nd  star. Lol Overall all great experience Public School. Food tasty came relatively quickly once ordered loved decor place.

My only very small issue server extremely nice taking care almost all tables area. counted least 6. never worked restaurant am sure if normal but two those six tables parties larger 10. She doing best she could but obviously took while check take entree order ordered appetizers. Other then amazing experience would definitely again just maybe slower night. Sadly gave place 3 tries instead third times charm 3 strikes you're out. getting Drinks wrong waiter keeping change without being told tip undercooked burgers being sent back 3 times seriously thought maybe hidden camera . Sadly love DTS appreciate having close home spots cocktails. off list. service good.. food okay.. eat lot garlic food all garlic.. ordered Grits Egg unable eat item..
Wow..
I am impressed GM called experience because professionalism concern..this shows he cares..I try 702 again .. Update review.. If loyalty club Insider I'd probably stay away. always seems some issue menu items drink selection promos etc. 
But sucker loyalty club! 

I weekday evening redeem Birthday Reward person joined me. sat bar ordered Flight School $5 3 chosen local craft brews 4 ouncers per e mail PS 702 received.  bartender told $5 flight wasn't local brews. did any reasonable person would ask if local brews. showed email. 
Lo behold consulting manager $5 local brews flight mine! Well 2 beers local porter Hop Nuts brew Bad escapes me. friend much beer snob happy ordinary $5 flight. Whatever didn't really care!

Service good always offered samples inquired certain beers case Rose tap. glass wasn't impressed. friend wings said great. ordered Benedict pizza very good next day. menu item used available brunch only. very rich filling tasty! fancy ham cheese roasted brussel sprouts topped eggs. Recommended breakfast lunch dinner! first time recommended friends kinda upset never before!! Everything good staff friendly theme restaurant cute! bbq burger cooked perfectly very excited try Public School 702 Downtown Summerlin!

This restaurant very fun charming overall schoolhouse theme! All staff pretty friendly helpful

There group four starving decided few things share amongst .... Bacon Cheddar Tots Sriracha ketchup deep fried tator tots bacon cheese inside served sirracha ketchup Chorizo Mac Cheese Emmental cheddar kale sea salt vinegar crunch Hand tossed pizza house pepperoni Mozzarella provolone crushed tomatoes jalapeños

I really enjoyed all choices would order them again! Amazing service outstanding food. Plus there's games play giant version jenga even beer pong! highly recommend chorizo mac cheese along crispy cauliflower during happy hour! absolutely love concept place. Gastropub great big space Happy Hour called Recess ? LOVE IT.  bad whole experience pretty subpar. 

In short whole 2 hour experience summed as really really hot outside seating poor service mediocre food  The happy hour only available bar area half outside patio. Considering LAS VEGAS if you're opening happy hour outside patio I'd hope could spare some misters working fans area.....or not. guess just sweat overheat ___  Fine if you're providing any cooling methods least sure enough water? much ask? Yes absolutely is. flag down waitress multiple times water. 

Not mention waitress coordinated would drop items almost onto us. 

Finally food really great.  Meh love location idea but don't think we'll coming back. wanting review place long now! 

This favorite trying new things place since babe trying many different restaurants eat at. surprise everything perfect when first entered when left. When walk atmosphere super hipster which enjoy . decor made feel wanted library study lol. Never thought I'd ever say that. indoor outdoor seating. also bar area looks super nice. sat booth outlets charge stuff pretty fancy if say myself . server came quickly drink orders right away. Babe lemonade water lemon per usual . She even gave water pitcher which pretty cool seeing lot places don't offer that. ordered calamari appetizer fried chicken sandwich grilled chicken quinoa salad. Everything super delicious. all tasty full flavor. Babe said he's never calamari good really enjoyed sandwich sauce salad dressing. 

We truly felt 5 star experience couldn't thank them enough filling bellies delicious food! If we're ever area sure we'll back! definitely wanna try sitting outside next time when cooler. 

Ps happy hour but only offered bar. boyfriend wanted someplace hadn't somewhere nicer walked Public School. Saturday night 8 30 maybe 15 other parties sat inside. tried order Appleton Cider but she let know completely all ciders. Okay just water start. THEN tried order entrees ordered Fish n Chips she let know Fish n Chips 5 other menu items. Mind menu isn't big first place. boyfriend wanted Turkey Melt but didn't either. said didn't want pay 1 beer boyfriend 1 appetizer hadn't walked out. kind restaurant half menu Saturday night?? back. Excellent Seared Scallop Brussels salad salmon plate.  Also tuna taco appetizer delicious.  

We sat patio ambience very relaxing.  Awesome place. Tom server he super nice knowledgable menu. husband brunch everything ordered delicious. started chorizo Mac cheese YUM! He orange juice bottomless mimosa 10$ plus. ordered breakfast burrito husband Benedict pizza. Everything super yummy plated nicely. usually come recess nice change very chill cool music school themed decor. favorite places Vegas. least favorable experiences here.   steak ordered medium rare steak.  tried eat sent back just asking if could put another minute.  All did burn outside.  Great now burnt steak thats raw middle.  just didnt eat complain further.  When asked check full uneatin steak no questions waitress decided sit POS station playing grab ass some guy worked kissing neck whispering ear while sat waiting pay uneaten raw piece meat.  It'll awhile before return.  Cauliflower app good. First time public school server Brianna made experience absolutely wonderful. Food decent however server great. We'll definitely back! Let's start positive. food quite good original. Bacon taters tots mezze plate hummus naan babaganoush tasty appetizers. Bison burger good though medium came closer rare. Wife said steak salad good. Beer cocktail menu very good. 

Service so so. reservations but still seated worst tables house right main entrance. Uncomfortable metal chairs wobbly table. 
Also main courses served 5 minutes dropped appetizers. Hate that. 

Ambience PS 702's real weakness. place cavernous uninspired its decor bizarre its traffic flow ridiculously jarringly loud. mean can't hear the people at your own table loud. Punctuated unexplained buzzer alarms might hear just before nuclear meltdown.

I'm glad gave try but doubt back. Although food pretty good environment made feel rushing through meal theme park food plaza. everyone suppose. Love place seated quickly using reservation Yelp ! Very friendly service already split checks without even asking! come back sure Perfect place hang your friends.
Service 10 1 10 each menu served different server all them served big smile feel happy place be.  Very positive energy.
Food 9 all them excellent except pizza salty . happy hour menu $10.00 liter red white wine. Tuna taco Parmesan truffle fries mini cheese burger deep fried cauliflower pizza
Bathroom 10 clean We suggested manager hook under table hang purses. don't put purse floor 
Next time sitting dining table dinner.
Love place! really enjoyed place! happy hour awesome! Food delicious unique. drinks also excellent. However service needs help waiter MIA when needed cocktail refills several times. wanted dessert but he never came back take order just said okkaayy guess we'll skip that. tip would much bigger he stayed it! Overall great place we'll back hoping better waiter. weren't impressed Happy Hour.  Menu limited seating picnic bench style uncomfortable.  elsewhere next time. Mixed bag high low points lunch Public School 702. ordered Edamame Hummus C.C.B. The Handheld Cobb . hummus definitely highlight. table four finished within couple minutes.

Unfortunately turning point occurred shortly thereafter when cut into burger raw egg white spilled out. say chicken patty flavorful but there's really no coming back kind mistake. Another major issue quinoa salad side...with no dressing pretty much waste.

The restaurant definitely takes school theme extremely far guess should props but personally found more weird charming. 2.5 Stars. Upset took away fav Mac cheese habanero coleslaw. Only reason came. Tried Public School lunch today experience fantastic! sure little loud during meal hours but enjoyed atmosphere great meal. beer selections par loved Crispy Chicken Sandwich! Phenomenal service staff hostess waitress Vanessa. If want some solid beer recommendations she's your girl! Great time back try more dishes explore mixed drink concoctions. Such fun place! Love love love much theme incorporated. Vegas needed fun spot off strip great food beer wasn't every other restaurant. Anyways! beer selection nice variety! even offered few tasters. apps really enjoyed buffalo cauliflower cheddar bacon tots. Blue cheese place delicious too! Another starter really enjoyed but family didn't heirloom tomato watermelon salad. Really refreshing but different! entrees fig prosciutto pizza good. Loved balsamic reduction drizzled top but didn't love hard crust was. sister said tacos great dad enjoyed fish chips. dessert Nutella cookie sandwich.. much bacon brittle all us. did still manage eat cookie ice cream parts though. Overall! service menu location atmosphere coming back sure! Yay. meet friends former customers informational fun meeting daughter. Friday during Happy Hour. Bar section looked fun busy. main dining room. Wine beer selection very good great deal choices but top notch names well balanced. few carry Sorachi Ace Brooklyn Brewery.

Appetizers nice. Meat Cheese board interesting but found awkward share. Meat sliced thinly tangled together ball making difficult take piece without touching stack. Cheese awesome but just small crumbles. Could excellent but business meeting great couple. Calamari good excellent choice 3 different sauces.  Tuna Poke ok.

Dining room loud carry conversation without some serious projection. Needs some acoustic work sure. 

Service very good! tried Public School 702 shortly opened business.

We started couple appetizers. didn't love calamari but typically don't enjoy fried calamari wasn't surprising. tater tots highlight appetizers. 

For entree ordered cobb burger chose kale brussel sprout slaw. When food came given fries instead but quickly noticed error brought slaw. burger cooked perfectly flavors great. Lots bleu cheese drippy egg slaw point well. enjoyed meal quite bit. 

The service very attentive. Some bit overzealous since restaurant just opened but appreciated extra effort. 

I'd interested coming back try more menu possibly happy hour some
Time soon. school concept cute planet lights composite notebook style menus however Ive cooler school themed bars restaurants authentic school buildings. lacks originality location but Cauliflower buffalo ordered damn good tried some CPK didn't compete come close public school 702's take. totally crave back! also tried coconut beer little bitter taste but bad. 3 times.
The first time AWFUL. birthday party food sucked service horrible wait times everything some worst ever experienced. ordering drinks appetizers food check would definitely say each thing took 25 minutes. drinks ordered came wrong when told waitress she replied nope  yours then came back said think right dropped off wrong drink ...we know. 
First rule customer service THE CUSTOMER ALWAYS RIGHT! Second third time came recess aka happy hour. service awesome but once again food just mediocre. 
I suggest happy hour but dinner. Definitely worth prices. atmosphere really great lot more character most restaurants. food fantastic beer selection point. I'd happy back any day week. wait staff also really friendly willing let sample beers until find right fit. great place eat drink! Josh great.  Came 3 friends order apps entrees share.  Great food great atmosphere great service.  definitely back.  Considering 4 f b background hit mark here.  Cauliflower bacon cheese tots chorizo mac burger all worth mentioning. 2nd visit. First time just o.k. however husband wanted try it. Second time same. really underwhelming especially service.  bit pricy small portions. creative menu which know most family would like. Probably won't back. many other much better  restaurants area. compete other restaurants really need step service food. Really bad service everything asked menu didn't because took off menu. Very few options.
I shrimp grits bacon cooked all way plust floating bowl gris! Disgusted! disappointed. Definitely worth money paid... never back definitely tell family friends all people know public school. really enjoyed place! many options even wife vegetarian. buffalo cauliflower amazing favorite craft cocktails well thought out. 

The reason receiving 5 stars. staff friendly energetic. server quick notice needed before knew needed instance buffalo sauce awesome cauliflower. Management stopped checked us. really know doing here! super disappointed experience restaurant. service food ordered things just did turn right stars kept coming off each bad encounter during visit. 

My husband planned graduation brunch party 10 good friends. When arrived restaurant 4 5 people hostess area. just talking each couple minutes noticed standing there. When finally acknowledged took over table just left. expected them let know server would but since table already set menus everything just left us.  where Star came off because felt moment staff didn't really care just thought oh big party let's through meals move onto next. 

We sat down looked through brunch menu bit then some friends decided bottomless drinks some just decided regular drinks. washed quite awhile even able order meals before flag server down ask if drinks even coming! servers reply Oh ugh find those. deducted another star watched walk each other tables serving them food drinks saw check each table no food drinks hand 10 minutes before caught attention. did appreciate attitude lack interest table watching nice attentive towards other tables. 

When food came when drinks also came out. very hungry point wanted try food see going match lack service server. ordered Pb j Burger. just okay. could've put more peanut butter jelly bun basically soaked most up. husband ordered parmesan truffle fries hummus toast. fries didn't come until he almost done toast server yet again flagged down it. When finally fries cold really presentable. Just looked sitting under warmer slapped slab parmesan top right before giving him. another star came off. 

When some people your party order bottomless think server would top checking those guests making sure received they're ordering satisfied drinks. Well didn't happen. took several flag server down several different times bring them bottomless drinks.  disappointing since gone many different places bottomless drinks each experience although different bad having always flag server down drinks. took another star away review. 

Overall disappointed lack attentiveness server lack compassion he showed because party bigger any other parties. restaurant packed did feel wanted there. food okay but would restaurant recommend family friends.
