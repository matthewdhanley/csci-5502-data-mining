 Glazier's pretty middle road me. Let start off saying store very strong strange odor lingered since first opened my husband says its tolerable find hard bear . layout nice store looks impressive compared most regular grocery stores Smiths Vons etc . large produce selection very affordable prices. Lots exotic fruit vegetables peppers cannot found conventional grocers. However herbs most greens less fresh selection organic produce lacking and way expensive when compared Trader Joes Whole Foods even Vons . great selection ready made food but few healthy options. Pizza ice cream sushi pasta salads pasta entrees vegetable starch sides etc. Some tried good including salmon stuffed spinach pesto green beans almondine mixed vegetable rice broccoli peppers etc. also nice looking coffee tea bar good selection gourmet bread La Brea Bakery olive bread jalapeno cheddar pain rustic organic whole grain etc . huge bakery donuts pastries pies cakes shockingly low prices but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar run mill cant hold candle Whole Foods but again prices incredibly reasonable. organic natural food section but organic eggs meat etc. 
I could regular grocery shopping but place great specialty items anyone shopping budget. far better Walmart Smart Final fact family owned. produce selection worth trip alone. also find myself coming when home late don't want cook ready made pre packaged food available 'till close midnight. wish they'd offer reusable bags discount card juice bar among ready made food stations. also wish they'd refresh magazines feel am twilight zone when stand line see covers weeks ago. absolutely love shopping here. store very clean extremely organized. great weekly specials meat seafood wine. am happy going anywhere else. Most grocery stores way busy long times. Its never long wait checkout food extremely fresh. truly recommended store don't see all hype over store. visited twice thinking should give second chance but trip bad first. store really dark wonder don't want see. classical music playing throughout place cheesy. produce section everyone raves just ok. Organic area small regular section mostly picked over empty. actually put produce selected back just head Whole Foods tomorrow work. butchers didn't seem friendly couldn't even eye contact me. Many items looked priced just high other markets. Self checkouts tacky lady running seemed think she better job she working. 

The thing really bothered way employees starring black couple checking trying steal. caught didn't even see rest customers watching them. Sad really. 

I shop ever again don't deserve money lame best las vegas rating plaster all over front joint. Though close always prefer shop Glazier's when nearby. thank Yelp since wouldn't known otherwise.

Glazier's far cleanest grocery store seen. nice selection products brands always seen most other stores. Many unique interesting products even found some considered ordering online since couldn't find them elsewhere. also own line products which pretty good. others said little everything then couple more didn't know would try.

Their bakery section some excellent pastries breads always fresh.
They even sugar free pastries treats.

Prices average similar you'd pay Smith's. some excellent weekly deals though example if buy 4lbs pork chops soft drinks mustard buns etc free..

Staff always polite friendly.

Glazier's only grocery store along Trader Joe's where decided buy something new looked interesting tasty wasn't disappointed. 

If happen live near Glazier's there's no reason why should shop elsewhere. Clean friendly overpriced variety rare interesting fresh products. Love Glazier's!  shopping since opened hae NEVER any problems except maybe over eating.  much good food!  Just deli counter chocolate covered bananas illy coffee fresh sushi fresh baked pizza panni sandwiches super yummers could on.  Then enjoy your food while listening player grand piano.  Then add grocery store plethora specialty foods homemade sausages.  good. Prices higher the same competitors. salad bar unique give them that. 1 star rating inappropriate service checker. also found non union no wonder service sub par . spoke manager said he surprised bad service because all compliments others... He only apologized asked why he wasn't sorry bad experience. many grocery stores area bothered bad service. favorite markets town just wish some employees cashiers would show more courtesy customers cashier named Priscilla would ring your items talking chewing gum open mouth. Then hands receipt saying ! Rather simple thank such
 unprofessional conduct love market. huge selection produce which seems cheaper other supermarkets. large selection already made meals just heat up. also salad bar pizza area sushi. great selection cheeses well. regular items feel prices bit higher example Walmart albertsons etc. but all all great supermarket. place great! Very prompt service wide veriety food court amazing...very clean well. steak night friday night 4pm 8pm let tell ya  great steak price. much offer...great prices...great staff...LOVE PLACE! While shopping them years recently made decision no longer shop Glaziers. Selection alright while some odd imported items Its much write home about. Produce selection hit miss other reviewers stated butcher no better any other supermarket I would much rather Butcher Block down road . Pricing items also pretty standard some deals some ripoffs. 

However thing really made decide shop elsewhere Shopping Gestapo keep posted front store. While some may refer them Greeters find very little greeting all mostly just stand front looking intimidating clearly loss prevention. Putting large orange stickers read paid any non bagged items Gestapo verify item indeed paid for.
Furthermore force leave any backpacks them now ride motorcycle such use backpack carry items back home. understand them allowing keep carries some risk but cameras watching isles relative difficulty stash something bag your back compared say... purse. feel all things bit much all shows poor respect your customers well detracts shopping experience.

Granted somewhat see why may started enforce such rule being high school sort near but rather ageist don't think? know look pretty young despite being adult but holding motorcycle helmet wearing protective gear. Would teenager looking shoplift things? Whats more say nothing helmet could hide something much faster while being much less assuming.

Anyway just experience taking business elsewhere. selection food good but fruit terrible condition. rotting.  gnats flying it. great deals meat here. also good loaf glaziers brand bread $1.13 good sized loaf. short anything but fruit. very often cruise through your local grocery store bump into owner ask product currently shelf appears few weeks later.  

Glaziers offers hard find east coast products flown special.  staff very helpful meat counter checkout.  prices higher your local Smiths Albertsons but offer 2 free items $25 purchase which typically offsets price differential.  

This primary market despite fact pass 3 other grocery stores way. thank note Mr. Mrs. Glazier...

Dear Mr. Mrs. Glazier Thank much hating retirement point opening best grocery store Las Vegas.  big thank when building said store nice enought build less two miles away house very thoughtful you!  Thank also Mrs. G keeping your amazing recipies secret sharing deliciousness us!  Thank having friendly helpful employees. loyalty forever.

Warmest Regards Lorrie

Seriously though... Hubby actually likes shopping here!  LOVE shopping here!  Best produce town without Whole Foods snob markup!  Love deli Love food court Love bakery Love Love Love Love meat section!  Everything fresh delicious affordable.  really love find stuff can't find anywhere else.  pretty much turned into store choice.  buy all produce meat bread some dairy now.  Yes right hand side store could more reasonably priced but don't mind paying excellent customer service convenience such well stocked store. Great store lots items don't see elsewhere wide selection freshly prepared food. Prices seem bit higher although quality also seems bit better. Great wine beer selection. salad bar unbelievable. almost same price salad McDonalds which isn't bad salad worthy fine restaurant. things salad bar numerous list. salad almost more could eat 6.38. pick ever want priced pound 6.88. best salad bars ever seen anywhere certainly bargain. Next time thinking getting fast food salad instead. Thanksgiving flying family planned very special few days.  highlights Turkey Day meal.  order 2 pre prepared meals 1. Butterball Turkey 1. Prime Rib Roast.  total joke quality preparation would expect market Glazier's reputation.

The meats turkey nearly cooked enough say need heat 1.5 2 hours cooked 3+ hours still somewhat under cooked.  prime rib need 30 mins.  meat bloody rare cook 90+ mins. medium.  Neither meat seasoned very well nor side dishes.  Thankfully Smith's nearby able needed meal flavorful.

The sides very disappointing some cases skimped.  Since ordered 2 meals six sides.  yams barely cooked contained huge non mashed chunks uncooked yam.  stuffing ok but only container nearly enough number people dinner claims serve.  green beans must very cheap because gave lot green beans zero flavor.  mashed potatoes ok corn.  rolls great but then packaged brand.

2 apple pies provided really very poor quality flavor texture such.

All all something would expected really bad restaurant.  sent note through website but big surprise no response chose let others know hard earned money.

We live 2 different cities all food prep utensils Scottsdale.  thought would great alternative.  WRONG! Used love place. Now if you're lucky find decent meat produce bad day two once home. Made trip Henderson Thanksgiving Free turkey if spend $150 promotion. course don't learn until checkstand does include meat dairy etc. course fell $20 short $150 required no free turkey me. tried explaining frustration several people them place sign explaining near frozen turkeys but no working seemed even care. last person spoke finally agreed but really felt lip service just rid me. absolute favorite grocery store Vegas. great selection produce always fresh. employees always friendly helpful check lines never long. also always great selection wines sale. just love vibe here. Whole Foods feel without price tag.  
I buy good quality greeting cards since they're 50% off.  Big assortment baked good meats seafoods etc. small Hawaiian selection sell Poke. Prices reasonable. Another crappy experience glaziers. Italian sandwich kitchen manager actually made me. guy crappy attitude see beginning. he finished making sandwich right before he wrapping asked throw pickles it. He says no pickles . He couldn't even look eye. see pickles right front halfway covered but see them. He just picks chooses he willing put customer's sandwich. Mr. Glazier your kitchen team sucks. Only reason keep coming back because use quality meat cheese. Here's thing love friendly staff produce eclectic prices meats wines unmatched offer food wine pairings every now then donuts AMAZING BOH staff ask if there's anything would see store 90% time ! why 1 star?  
I overlook fact ok letting dogs in. Little dogs leashes big dogs 93 lb handler could bearly handle people carrying dogs....UGH list !  
Dogs shed puppies pee when they're  excited due panting...THEY SLOBBER all over open produce baskets!!  shopping past 3 years cuz great things without running all over paying little extra.  Every now then would see dog your store YES would complain but last night last straw...3 dogs less hour...PAU!  many  just  seen. Security should stop them BEFORE customer complains after.  guys just lost 1 Hawaii family black hair pizza. Literally. moment thought could mine because black hair but pull stuck! Baked right into dough! disgusted because hair appeared same spot just taken bite. spit bite fast just couldn't eat anymore. Interesting food tons east coast favorites great deli nice selection grocery staples. even lobster steamer site steam your lobster shrimp no cost. Bonus local business feels great support. Love place. absolutely love store.  feels nice people super friendly.  Its different atmosphere down music plays.  Great place shop. am nature creature habit finding difficult change.  why first visit Glazier's Warm Springs Rd. Durango first entering store thought back Whole foods where haven't over year don't ask .
To surprise glee found much better stocked then most City finding products long wished see again. also found delight Drakes Devil Dogs no more expensive shipping East Coast only $5.49 eight.
What really pleased most finding Ahi Tuna sale. haven't years most Japanese restaurants find expensive carry.
I also luck find large organic Fuji apples am eating right now crisp  sweetly satisfying.
I highly recommend Glazier's Market address having done enough shopping lifetime making them first choice whenever need food supplies.
Mmmmm Fuji apple delicious! place massive! Lots inexpensive fresh produce may may find Albertson's Smith's Vons. Where find 4 lbs yellow onions just .98 cents? Glazier's.

I agree Clint B. seafood selection impressive!... only seafood but selection baked goods bbq sauces international vegan products etc. Seems prices cheaper Whole Foods Trader Joe's. Smith's Walmart may still items cheaper but Glazier's paying quality.

The only time concerned when found hair deli items stuffing purchased.

Worth checking if live around area! having lunch Glaziers food court. table near occupied old man shopping cart full files. realized he Mr Glazier. cool thought myself he hands owner. thought immediately crushed when another man file cart came table assume manager. having conversation became heated. dismay horror heard them refer certain employees such racist remarks couldn't even finish salad bar lunch. can't patronize business when management much disregard customers employees. place all would want grocery store.  great meat seafood department.  really love gourmet brands imported NYC...amazing!  Best all prices better Vons Whole Foods Sprouts Trader Joes. Hands down best grocery store LV.  girlfriend live nearby where most shopping food household items.  customer service phenomenal.  If could dream perfect supermarket would it.  Theres bakery hot food line butcher salad bar selection wines cheeses good too.  store immaculately clean well stocked all times.  carry items wouldn't find most grocery stores even suggest stock something particular if don't already it.  Love shopping here.  cashiers security guards super friendly know name.   Glaziers sets standard which measure every other supermarket. Don't let protesters scare place rad! love everything store fresh cheap. employees great. cakes cheap delicious better any bakery. salads cooked foods good too! Armenian lavash gata other great Mediterranean selections. fiancé 2 year old daughter shopping glaziers over year now always good experiences until today. daughter likes hold couple balloons while walk around store then put them back when finished shopping. Today though when getting ready leave fiancé getting balloons daughter when older man blue suit came ripped them daughters hand. When fiancé says put those back he just rudely replies no already messed take over hour fix then just walks away. Unfortunately did see happen. instead getting more items pay when told cashier rude employee she said he owner. Well any owner treat customers let alone child really doesn't care people keep business. many other stores give any business. stopped way home great day while deli area distracted manager Rick chewing employees.  made stop tracks couldn't believe he actually berating poor employee sales floor front customers other employees.  

I am really complain but couldn't believe unprofessional asked store manager.  woman told Rick manager duty said uh no he issue with.  few minutes later met Pat he waved off issue because Rick new manager.  He said he would talk but he really didn't seem appreciate concern.  Rick new he learn he tells me. manner very condescending.   said any other person working better manager Rick turned walk away.  bottle wine fell cart smashed foot.  Pat quickly called other people broom mop.  He never asked if okay.  He walked away stood trying figure clean wine off shoes ask cashier towel.  cleaned still standing noticed foot bleeding ask bandaid.  Pat never asked doing if wanted sit down anything. He came back Looks having bad day. The only person expressed any concern man cleaning mess.  He asked twice. shopping first time other day recommendation friend boy happy followed advice.  Shopping pleasant experience market nicely laid well staffed.  prices fair would say quality produce meat products possibly lower end.  really such large hot food counter having 3 mini restaurants inside market.  also deli counter put your order come back when you're done shopping don't stand around waiting.  also some shrimp cooked them dinner last night really happy say tat well cleaned did taste fishy bad which happen all often Vegas.

To put succinctly really happy Glazier's now local market. First thing first only write review if service food bad 1. left business fuming. 2. VALID CONCERN

Yesterday those days fuming Glazier's market!
Here's happened I ordered baby shower cake 2 days advance. knew would problem...the person taking order no clue take it. thought call sure but didn't. paid left phone number gave person order half vanilla sheet cake says congrats... hot pink gerber lillies. Main thing paid gave them time easy instruction.

Day shower two hours before NO CAKE. never called asked if copy looked official form. no clue talking receipt bright orange sticker said PAID. guess enough. 

Therefore cake some reason never knew why never made. picked cold case way person took order said often stay 2 weeks because forget take them out...but nonetheless young man said still really good now  pick blue cold case...it some pink a shower GIRL ....and am fuming! Another person comes 4 small packages thought happy meal toys asked if wanted one. 'WTH they?' ask. people don't talk. consumer NO CLUE happening business transaction. Oh well thank you....they tiny baby shoes top cake....that match look 1907. Thank thank very much. last comments MANAGER? mute attendant someone grey bob hair cut says course pointing person offered Happy Meal toys without telling but just handing 4 plastic whatevers...


I take cake fuming assuring them CALL MONDAY WHEN TIME. 

Alas take stupid mismatched cake that could two weeks old car. need buy soft drink wine yes wine! $50 gift card party don't want take cake while shopping. Heavens hey may think am stealing even though official documentation.

I 6 bottles wine...I notice 9.95...they all 5 something...they no idea where gift cards no idea why sales price isn't coming up. slow confused. blood boiling heart racing sweat literally always happy face melted into frown. 
I can't take it...I am done leave bursting door.

Let say only did people late baby shower hosting wasted TIME. All occurrences could avoided 1. Training kid took order properly 2. Called when question order 3. Spoke why order did made instead just staring 3rd eye didn't right angry...especially when  look case alone looking similar cake flavor ordered. no didn't pick something else! 

Very disappointing since just bought new home place. Admittedly Vegas doesn't much offer way fresh produce store decent pricing good quality such Whole Foods. also salad bar which great ate when ordered cake THAT FIRST TIME . well bought scoop gelatto that ok.....but ate it . am family person does need reasonable pricing seem have. addition need time feature many families lack. am mad wasted mine didn't even flinch respond take ownership FAULT.

I assure people continue because some nice features store but think it'll last see me.

Monday mornings am bestowed front door fresh milk  produce box meats delivered Winder Farms. THOSE PEOPLE FANTASTIC AM LOYAL. Still. shopping when need things but place it....


You lost fine customer Glaziers really did. need more management process training communication skills people know WOW customers them fume.

Good riddance! Liked look selection store. first visit since live Henderson don't close by. wanted try angus beef rib eye steaks advertised over Labor Day weekend. ones butcher case very thin asked butcher if could some thicker cut. cooked them home tough!  REALLY tough!  glad didn't stock them. am fed food court. Ordered tender combo every single week past 3 years now order drink separately ? tender combo just 3 pieces chicken fries $6.87. Then uhm drink? Oh no  separate. ordering meal combo does include drink? Since when? loyal customers notice things this.. drink 2.15. total TEN DOLLARS meal always no more 7$. never order drink separately. place damn lucky there's no other food walking distance besides Burger King hate food court workers. They're idiots. Neither workers even knew right.. thanks ripping off most negative reviews blatant rude security policy. weekly shopper despite HORRIBLE ROTTING PRODUCE i lots other fun stuff but neighborhood much more convenient Sprouts Trader Joes.

Twice last month so First time being followed employee. first just thought going same way but then few minutes realized every time stopped stopped. Every aisle down down. thought odd. Second time employee cut off wine section gets radio another asking one? while pointing then walks past slowly while glaring looking into cart. should walked then there. Instead NEVER RETURN. everything want Amazon. absolutely love store!! Great prices! Great product produce.. caters single families but also many bulk items.. 
I shop just every week.. favorite stores las vegas! Very decent grocery market southwest Vegas.  store normal grocer lot individual items found larger chain stores.  Glaziers chain store.  found lot East Coast based items rarely found West Coast.  store area quick eats take but does seating area eating.  deli area impressive promoting mostly Boars Head products.  area end deli packages pre made meals sides.  organic section any larger most normal grocery stores.  aisle Hawaiian goods also.

As another reviewer expressed market Whole Foods.  normal grocery store some perks.  There's only Vegas if lived closer I'd probably more.  worth checking out. foodieview Friday steak night. never steak dinner served neighborhood grocery pleasantly surprised tasty was. atmosphere commendable grand piano playing dining area steak perfectly grilled ordered it. upgraded New York strip bone in porterhouse cooked medium. nicely sized over seasoned. Delicious! steak comes two sides brought such stout service easy forget you're grocery. hope Glaziers keeps doing excellent Friday night family event becomes locals' tradition! ready new grocery store when heard Glazier's coming. huge 'foodie couldn't wait. carry items Eastern part US. Drakes Wise ... international food isle better Albertsons Vons Smiths. stuff usually pick San Diego nice!  don't usually into much detail but warranted. Ok let's go.
1. Produce always fresh n good price

2. Mrs. G's Salad bar fresh! potato salad only potato salad buy grocery store.

3 Meat Dept Huge selection! Always fresh carne asada $2 00 cheaper Albertsons tastes better!

 4 Employees always nice. always someone greet door.

5 Nice soda selection

6 Overall clean nice selection East Coast items for Vegas I pretty much split grocery budget between Glazier's Albertsons. Wal Mart only good canned goods tortillas. Glazier's friendly place certainly Best Las Vegas.  8 30 am approached meat fish counter.  6 people working behind counter.  few minutes being ignored someone finally came over asked wanted.  good morning  welcome which long way customer satisfaction but need some help? Remember 8 30 am can't more 5 customers entire store.  previously looking packaged porterhouse steaks which less inch think asked man behind counter if could 2 porterhouse steaks cut inch half thick.  He looked somewhat bothered look said yes but he could charge sale price $6.98 lb.  asked he would charge he said $9.98 lb.  

The two steaks would probably 3 lbs. total he wanted charge $9.00 just cut two steaks.  Isn't sole job butcher cut meat?  guess Glazier's.  isn't job any business customers happy satisfied possible?  guess Glazier's.  Stay away market somewhere else where actually care patrons. manager store should pay attention kind attitude.
Their meats good there. star rating last visit only.
This cashier didn't say hi thank you. kind sales person that?
They don't overly friendly but should least say thank you. place awesome...
I found Vienna hotdogs...
I'm Chicago...
Best grocery Las Vegas Nv good grocery store great prices conveniently located SW town. bought several fish fillets deli but time when bought Boston sole fillets found few worms moving before cook. back store deli next day took look Boston dover sole fillets again noticed most them contaminated! asked butcher if normal he said no but didn't seem surprised. then spoke manager she asked if wanted money back lol. don't tend keep grocery receipts declined..but she said common fish fly contaminated sometimes butchers don't remove all worms completely some customers don't mind wtf? Thats definitely thing never ever heard yuck! never see fish same..thanks glaciers! place ran very rude unprofessional prejudice people.
The food quality awful prices ridiculous.
The employees just rude owners. asked speak owner rude manager Mr. Glazier himself surprisingly rude absurd! 
I NEVER return poorly ran business again. love place. butcher selection best area can't compare quality meat anywhere else south west Vegas. deli amazing really fresh pasta. only reason why didn't give them 5 stars because some things pricier side. Although some good sales some wine. good supermarket lot variety. lot items only east coast. bagels made water straight New York. stop pretty frequently pizza. when order delicious. Great fresh supermarket little pricy but cheaper whole foods similar kind if store. massive largest its kind vegas run lot specials which keep coming back Mostly love store. produce deals good but careful....I've found produce doesn't last long. pizza Wed 5.99 hard beat. ice cream. often great wine specials grocery store. love see Mr Glazier almost every time come! Last week saw he selling girlscout cookies them! No profit him! 

He supporting Forbuss elementary my son constantly since he opened southwest baked goods awesome. HOLY FRITTERS BATMAN! Way involved community quality business Mr G! Great deli prepared dishes. bad employees seem underwhelmed jobs. Don't plan going back. very excited when store first opened. first place appears nice store. deli sells boars head some food items Chicago  why gave 3 stars. downside. meats terrible. seem old judging color. produce terrible too. only places seen soft limp dakon. Better off going Trader Joes Sprout market. love market. Everytime find exactly need. Veggies fruit all fresh delicious.  love shopping here. carry everything but pricing also reflects that. Expensive yes. also expired food shelves. 75 % employees rude want help customers. place needs improvement . give store 2 stars few employees nice helpful there. Unless things improve cannot shop due health concerns. Glazier's definitely growing me. Every time seem find another reason should shop more often. usually split shopping Trader Joe's Fresh Easy along stop two VONs throughout week. While Glazier's isn't replacing any altogether definitely added rotation. 

Great produce selection great prices. Fruits veggies some cheapest town. Bakery section deserts amazing. heard owners NY area see influence bakery desert section. 

You also find some other east coast brands no find elsewhere. mean knew when saw Yancey's Fancy cheese guys going way source good brands back east. 

If miss east coast grocery store experience would find good check place out. deli  place amazing jersey shore sandwich huge cheap pizza good friendly staff great prices. most grocery shopping store. very clean organized. huge selection meats deli always find something new if looking. only put your order pick later when done shopping. seafood Butcher section store always fully stocked great selections well. ice cream stand sandwich stand dinner specials well. some pretty unique items haven't seen anywhere else which nice because try new things. Don't mind people outside protesting store if anything want ro support store more. true mom pops place love able support. highly recommend making trip Glaziers seeing yourself!! Glazier's used best donuts town. huge always good. drove half way across town least once week buy couple dozen office. Today walked donuts completely different. half size. asked another shopper she said definitely made change worse. guess need find new place donuts now. hope hear message enough people change back. Worst check service any grocery store Rachel worst manager town.  Ruin good store.  shop here.  Maybe should think hiring experienced workers. perhaps training. going store since opened become more loyal specifically because owner always around store. He greets every time see always time chat. He really knows treat customers way promotes loyalty. travel 1 hour to every time shop but gladly only b c good prices products esp fruits vegetables but also b c feel affinity toward owner. Keep Mr. G! and also Mrs. G also see walking around too! Wow came into Glazier's Christmas day looking amazing seafood deal fancy dinner two. Low behold LIVE LOBSTER $7.77 lb top off steam them free! walked door 2 lobster 2 small rib eyes some other necessities fab Christmas dinner. Everything meat seafood department looked amazingly fresh prices VERY competitive. Hands down favorite grocery store. just friendly reminder why. New Yorkers kind supermarket. carry Boar's Head alot brands found east coast. If your trans plant ny love place. just popped store pick some last minute items dinner. don't normally shop but way home. grabbed grapes pork chops mushrooms. phone husband while self checkout. scanned first item heard beep placed grapes bagging area.

I hear sharp yell Ma'am! Those grapes didn't scan! off phone point look see scowl face. She marches over. tell heard register beep when scanned. She says unnecessary attitude never scan. She asks if some random number SKU. all interesting questions considering don't work here.

She punches number finish transaction. She gives look only describe smug  satisfied she stopped great grape smuggle 2017.

Here's thought. If Glazier's spent more time educating employees customer service instead treating customers criminals maybe would doing better. Glazier's regular stop each week groceries. great specials fresh meat seafood. Mrs. G label deli meats good value too. Mrs. G wheat bread all buy days. Produce prices among best around. else great variety everything... many brands won't find elsewhere. appreciate little adventure shopping which likely why enjoy Glazier's much. best grocery stores too. much variety can't found most stores. love order deli kiosk all ready pick before check no line! also some great deals meat selections. whole atmosphere awesome!! Overall enjoy grocery store but few words caution sure inspect anything buy seafood section. purchased stone crab claws upon opening bag steam them saw dark blue blackish discoloration inside shells each claw. Turns moldy. Bonus manager would accept return.  Despite flown daily sign obvious sell rotten seafood time time. know supermarket pretty cool when don't even NEED anything. just wanna walk around! Clean fully stocked its own unique soundtrack Glazier's shopping experience. Where begin...

Produce fans rejoice cause only ton great specials! Humming right along seasons whatever fruit veggie its prime you'll find right front. also lot exotic fruits choose which cool. your way further left store you'll find favorite things Glazier's. serve Boars Head cold cuts. ONLY cold cuts mess with...you never buy slimy generic meats ever again. Coming NY appreciate any store carries those fine products. butcher tons prepared marinated no work meats choose including shish kabobs look awesome. 

The salad bar fresh packed yummy toppings if you're looking scarf something down cafe home front TV. can't even talk food court strip front store...SO wonderful even if basket food fully intend cook night something suck in. Love paninis. 

The aisles wide great selection brands lots can't find normally here. good example Ronzoni pasta back east fave. 

The staff super friendly almost fault since you've now purchased much food just want check speed home eat all. No rewards program yet though what's that? Oh now if you've walked all around store you've noticed odd music laugh. figured play very dramatic instrumental versions movie music sometimes feel  breaking into interpretive dance. bit overkill. 

Overall great shopping experience. glad near house! light Glaziers closing would say wish owners all best health problems. know both relief much devastation family all its customers. provided people wanted well needed. Good luck them family. Best wishes them. hope kick illness butt. same store when first opened during its first 2 years.

It's great Glazier's mom and pop operation Mr. Mrs. G. hands on accessible. appreciate efforts bring many regional products brands East Coast Midwest help those homesick transplants. offer large variety foodstuffs everyone whether cook scratch grab fresh ready made grub. deli very comprehensive generally reliable Boar's Head line.

However shopping today requires much more effort. Produce hit miss quality availability. seen grapefruit potatoes mold. many expired items shelves various departments condiments dairy being worst . just recently expired  months ago expired. really take time scrutinize everything purchase. Some suction seal lids popped jars even though plastic wrap still intact.

I still shop because products can't elsewhere but now bigger chore ensure don't bring home any duds. often see union people street picketing Glazier's know Glazier's must doing something right. Your review helps others learn great local businesses.

OMG...I just home checking place. thought Heaven. grocery store clean hook beginning. Then began walk around more more satisfied. bakery section strawberry shortcake $5.98 carrot cake $3.98 much more. continued walking noticed large party platters varied $29.99 $54.99. pasta salads fruits veggies meats wings. prices definitely reasonable. Most saw cheaper Walmart Food4less. check out. Glazier's addresses big concerns grocery stores Valley variety. loathe having only few options when shop. know studies show many people function better limited choices. But am those people. function better MANY choices Glazier's just gets part me. seeing 20 different bar be que sauce varieties shelf. lets people actual decisions products want bring into home. Contrast 8 varieties provided many local chains around town I'm talking Smith's Vons . 

I avoided purchasing non perishables but tremendous options every area store. always seeing BUY offers around store. don't care if just trying reel in. Add BOGO offers FREE tortilla chips every $25 purchase. Winning! Frugal shoppers excited deals that. 

Overall prices bit high but any specialty store increase price point bit. did bother me. liked layout store general organization. being family owned matters me. should matter everyone. If am side town would rather give money professional family owned company some other choices. 

I didn't see many perishable organic options but doesn't seem Glazier's about. serving variety East Coast product options busy area town.  Glazier's leading way toward more diverse well organized thoughtfully stocked locally owned neighborhood markets? only hope so. Sorry see now!  Great store higher average pricing Las Vegas supermarket.  deli nice but selection foods very expensive.  Almost $9 small little lasagna?  C'mon Whole Foods not.  
I enjoy foods back east but must pay fortune.  regularly priced items also very high.  Wheat Thins 1 box $1 Smith's $2 regular brand.  Glazier's $3.99.  high prices carry over other foods such mustards milk meats.  place would Weekly if could afford it.  No wonder almost empty every time shop. place great well priced better other major grocery store chains town.  Also big plus customer service!  Everyone customers employees much nicer.  feel relax shop rather rush done because all rude people other grocery stores.  highly recommend anyone looking shop local save money groceries. oh Glazier's would without you? sad when checkout people know name but am everyday. Convenient. Never Crowded. Staff amazing store very clean. organic food section very impressive. best hummus slections seen vegas thus far olive oregano...tomato basil..and all fresh small local company.

They also great wraps. forget its called but next pizza stand when first walk in. salsalito turkey  fave! Avacado spread spicy turkey always jalepeno wrap.... open till 12. more ask for? Glazier's yet best town me. mention great Fruit Cake comes reasonable price! delicious always come back it. D food court better mall's! First visit store.  Should visited much earlier missing lot.  Easy parking clean well laid store.  Fresh veggies meats excellent variety seafood.  real icing cake found scrapple satisfy southern roots.  food court area pizza salad bar deli sushi fried fish.  Friday nights 4 8 pm steak order breakfast weekends.  even piano near seating area.

Will definitely shopping spot. Visited Glazier's first time other day .  felt very impressive market all described HOWEVER visit during early Thursday afternoon when must no more ten customers whole gigantic store.  fresh meat selection huge extensive as fresh seafood counter .  turn over such large quantities fresh perishables apparently few customers??

I purchased some fresh perch dinner looked very good when store.  Unfortunately throw when home spoiled also slight smell highly diluted bleach an old butchers trick mask off odors .. . . . Also single check lady duty took almost 8 minutes process small 11 item collection groceries.  She much talkative even though paid simple cash very very slowwwww. great clean store shop in. love variety items cannot find anywhere else town fact if ask certain item usually in.  only complaint found expired food shelves multiple times.  should check vendors just train employees remove expired product shelves. don't know anything if haven't store!! sweet deals meats seafood poultry etc.etc. First time really thought another Whole Foods type place.  But really slowly started discovering market items won't find VON'S SMITH Albertson's. If think item can't find other markets GLAZIERS 90% time. seen many selections won't find anywhere else.  also wide selection prepared food. if don't feel cooking. talking meals.  Oh also found smoked turkey legs oh good!!! Come check if haven't already...This very impressive store to. Ive couple times. actually yesterday 12 1 17 okay girl works check line she really short hair .. everytime !! mean everytime she very dirty look face she judges alot . appreciate mean rude looks people family.  Now dont even feel comfortable going place anymore check girl looking sister moms cart much it. Which very disrespectful. Dont wrong love store amazing products just dont appreciate disrespect employee . Customer service very important. Glazier's Von's closest stores house.  eat  75% time only hit grocery store every 2 3 weeks.  hit Glazier's least 10 times since opened.  basic recommendation  when walk into store stay your left bakery deli seafood meat sections AWESOME .  

The deli meats little high side ...WORTH !

The seafood selection great !  few weeks ago 21 25 Shrimp $4 pound  GREAT ! 

I picked lobsters bisque prime rib roast Christmas dinner PERFECT !

Donuts ...60 cents each NICE 

They own sausage 6 7 types try TRIED THEM ALL !  

Have knock them star right side store ain't cheap but some unique items can't find other grocery stores Valley.

I few decent restaurants area but least grocery store  cut above ! love place enough 5 star but really wish wouldn't wasteful put those stupid paid stickers everything. Even when brought own reusable shopping bag still stickering! asked she said rule. crock!! 

The security guy front doesn't even pay attention stickers. once left 9 gallons water bottom cart only put line just told ring 10. she didn't sticker 9 underneath guy front didn't say boo it. Also isn't receipts for?? Proof purchase.

Stop being wasteful Glaziers! love much this. reason reason only... am forced revoke your well deserved stars. favorite market Las Vegas. Great produce section ton specialty items cannot find anywhere else. family owned ton different departments such deli seafood butcher sushi meals pizzeria coffee bakery etc. etc. etc . only downside some frozen items non perishables little more expensive but just don't certain items rest grocery shopping quality made all other places. Huge isles friendly staff... your typical chain market. plus request tickets customers order specific items brands etc stock you... Oh also homemade sausage section various prepared meals darn good. really want place...... but last 4 times tried buy organic vegetables all horrible quality. Some even mold them! also bought some Vlasic pickles opened when home found them rotten expiration date 2 months earlier! fault check store but don't know could possibly happened if rotating stock. Flowers very affordable $8.88 dozen rose

Glaziers discount American greeting cards gift wrap 50% off 365 year! WOW!! new favorite place shop! nice clean but most all friendly! produce looks great! used Von's it's ok but kind impersonal. 4 times now say consistently very very good. 
I'm elderly knowing people. There's such sweet cashier. name Yvonne. Whenever she sees she smiles sure ok if need help. just me she's nice everyone.  She commented new things store even shared few quick recipes me. really feel home family owned. live close drive way because carry lot items Chicago NY can't find most places. Delicious fresh frozen pastas Vienna giardiniera Vienna neon green relish many more favorites. meat selection usually pretty good too.  all for. Prices regular items higher most stores others mentioned produce terrible! 

There large area prepared sandwiches pizza etc.. large deli but never tried any no opinion. First let start Elaine automated self check out. assistance all asked 8 dollars needed change for. Well she seemed lazy count change she actually sent another register she already opened register could easily pulled 8 dollars it. If you're already working register opened difficult part counting $8. absolutely dislike lazy employees. She did everything power rid soon possible.

So over Wanda ask same thing. Thankfully she took time count but sighed 3 times process. didn't ask ladies climb mountain... only asked change. am paying customer just everyone else take time provide quality service without sighing passing off another register. Las Vegas service industry think good service before think workload coming your way.

I give 1 star because food good but service horrid. LOVE LOVE LOVE grocery store!! 

First all always clean. Spotless actually impeccably organized. store stocks much absolutely incredible easy find things. shelves always completely full everything want constantly getting experience new finds.  favorite thing store find food other regions!  example husband NJ lots things he likes when visit family.  shocked find some foods local Glazier's.  found fresh pastas Chicago mustard only able find Cleveland etc.  Chances might able find your own tastes home! 

The deli absolutely top notch featuring Boar's Head meats cheeses.  ordered many party trays them including fruit veggie cracker meat shrimp. always time super fresh. thing really ordering trays display case actually see ordering.  ordered cakes cupcakes bakery addition purchasing cookies donuts etc. All super tasty! 

There food court store which offers all types different food well salad bar ice cream! way never grocery shop while hungry! manager prepared foods Marge horribly rude.  avoid shopping because her. Glazier's actually become grocery store moved side town. Albertson's much closer only if am short time but prefer drive extra few minutes hit Glazier's.

I grocery shop little different now a days since just am buying groceries other people buy food eat. going store little assorted Italian cookies bakery cases choose put white bags. brought back visits Saint Louis 'The Hill' which Italian area buying little gems bakery. Except Glazier's pick choose which ones own rather saying handful point little pistachio cookies. 

The cheese department does lack refinement but your basics non imported brie camembert but yet find triple Crème Brie here. Occasionally pick truffled pate which cheese case kind lack cheese refinement. extensive deli selection prepared foods generic sushi bar pizza etc . also buy some gelato assume eat while shop. never done but think may something try soon sounds fun! 

Also never leave without buying bottle two booze. always giving samples try just wine. sampled bought HUG Italian sparkling wine Wild Tonic Kombucha. tend great sales wine which excellent single woman shopping. times came home bottles Coppola wine because prices phenomenally lower other markets liquor stores. Please ask beer selections because beer check yourself.

It smaller grocery store but bigger Trader Joes if looking something 'specific' many find but basics need Pate liquor spot... unless open TJ's hood. place all east coast food items drakes cakes chicken cutlets. 
Yesterday last visit. 
I bought two packages chicken cutlets expiration date 11 8 16. also bought two pack ribeye's expiration 11 7 16.

As cook steaks last night other side steaks huge gray spots beef should gray. 
I would eat them. 
This morning opened chicken cutlets prepare them dinner tonight. slime two packages thick gross took good look chicken turning gray pink. threw them out. basically threw money garbage. 

This store really gone down hill. many rotting produce now meat department. does pass inspection. LOVE place!  Great groceries great customer service. salad bar absolutely amazing!  many delicious toppings careful cause adds up!  But totally worth it!  restaurant area grocery store booths seating. food great both hot cold foods. heard steak dinner amazing. haven't tried sure if still it. bummed can't visit often since moved across town. also love meat section. There's normally specials yellow and or black containers 5 $20. deal includes raw meat steaks pork chops chicken.  But also includes cooked meats chicken wings breaded veal chops. produce very fresh options store overall best. wish location northwest side town! definitely back giant pizza alone! totally shocked selection price groceries. think found new favorite!!! most grocery shopping here.  excellent service products staff favorite all grocery stores Las Vegas. especially butcher section. almost always except occasional time closed pop into Venus other place. Love market place. wide variety fresh fruit vegetables. Lots weekly specials. new market when want something special. wife love supermarket. everything. salad bar kept nice clean. large variety toppings always replenished. price reasonable your own salad. store large there's lot good variety items sale. 2 3 restaurant like shops some really good food. wish 215 North Decatur. Much better.. Sorry Von's.

Family run owner usually property. Super friendly staff. Excellent prices. Amazing butcher. Great deli. Produce gives any Mexican market run its money.

Speciality items place.

Glazier's Food Marketplace best Vegas. No question it. weird rate review grocery store?  NOOOOOOO!!!!  Especially when Glaziers totally awesome!  discovered grocery store when lived near Jones Robindale.  no healthy grocery stores area carry ton organic items except Whole Foods which always pricey inconveniently located Town Square always crowded long lines etc.  When found Glaziers excited find Hawaiian food + ton organic international items.  grocery store well rounded amazing customer service pricing great!  usually buy full week's groceries $100 which amazing.  When shopping other competing grocery stores area Smiths Albertsons etc grocery bill usually around $150 per week.

They fresh bakery awesome boars head deli counter well.  order your deli meat through app computer system front counter.  somewhat more convenient but seems since added system ordering process actually takes longer just asking employee requesting.  sure if solved problems time but definitely them more efficient only printed ticket.  No more errors...so  good.

Their produce always super fresh if ask employee produce area anything know entire store assist any question concern.  super helpful.  

You don't need membership card anything shop Glaziers.  If sale sale.  only thing advise if live area check your mail.  Sometimes mailers great coupons additional discounts offer. left rave review Glaziers few years back but much time things changed good.  Glaziers neighborhood market feel which absolutely love!  However produce department become basically worst.  dislike Vons Albertsons Smiths yet there's no competition when comes fresh fruit.  Finding somewhat ripe Avacado Glaziers IMPOSSIBLE.  Fresh raspberries no ma'am.  Many times there's just completely basic things.  No cilantro no basil etc.   hope fixed sucks no longer there.  

Lastly music.  C'mon guys.  awful.  literally leave headache.  If want keep simple traditional might recommend classical music? few times because lazy drive regular soho few more miles down. never really took place in. Then day heard salad bar back. didn't even remember seeing first few visits. When heard choir laid eyes said salad bar mention gelato pizza sushi name it. Crazy missed it. place awesome. Salad bat even better whole foods. Very clean well kept. Music background u feel you're shopping movie. keep getting loopy cashier just loves talk plans once she's free. Can't stay away place. Dukedom come ever eaten frog legs? Yeah well...  me! But admit store grown me. really love cultural influence store.

I still believe store mostly overpriced. when shop stick outside perimeter store. hit fresh fruits fresh salad bar deli department meat department dairy department. pretty much skip isles. 

They most amazing deli. Honestly every Sunday now just egg salad cranberry chicken salad California tuna salad. great fresh Hawaiian loaf bread. lunches during week! other part deli great selection deli meats. place order kiosk then shop while being prepared thickness specifications eat meat. even text when order ready. No more waiting deli counter lunch meats! When little time things huge difference.

The meat department always cool items stuffed crabmeat crab shells stuffed clams clamshells. last time fresh frog legs. Really... eats that? something everyone though. 

If only could just lower prices standard items ketchup cereal would another store rest groceries. such amazing market! Though prices higher most carry many specialty items find major retailers. amazing bakery most delicious items kids love donuts weekends! While wide variety foods choose from. find prices little pricey side. store also appeared dark dimly lit little dirty. only come all east coast nostalgic. fact place overpriced hire biggest idiots. Let tell coffee experience today stop coffee shop order iced mocha iced white mocha. girl looked maybe 16 pulls coffee recipe book. where should said Nevermind. no problem people using recipe books but problem when don't know simple measurements. She takes 18oz cup proceeds pick ice. She looked she really feared ice bucket. She finally gets scoop ice then grabs gallon milk. She poured 17oz milk cup!  when flipped canceled order. ordered coffee iced milks. When cancelled explained much milk she looked all bewildered abused teen Lifetime movie. just can't over fact she couldn't something simple coffee. Then start checking cashier throws wonder bread into cart. Seriously THROWS it. Funny thing sort incompetence wouldn't tolerated NYC. loved shopping Glazers until today. because ad fairlife milk. When checked milk price wrong. husband brought attention. She asked another employee check price employee couldn't find item. Meanwhile stood waited. back took picture ad text husband standing line. He showed she giggled questioned if wasn't real. employee supposed finding price never returned paid all other food left without milk. Dumb clerk ...not good business. Every time visit Vegas drop Glazier's Food Marketplace pick some juice veggies fruit perhaps some sausage bread condiments some tasty healthy meals between amazing restaurant feasts. don't need eat every single meal enjoy life!

They always great selection organic veggies good luck fruit also! Plus prices fair considering we're middle freaking desert!

I can't wait back Vegas. Red Rock O'Sheas Ramen China Town Buldogis Bachi Burger Gambling til sun comes beyond free alcohol interesting people all over world more free alcohol. Paradise. When found store almost 3 years ago grocery store would gotten well over 5 stars. 2010 grocery store Las Vegas check due friendliness quality items. store HUGE!

The chicken breasts still cheapest town ground beef seems good quality no pink slime detected produce seems good deals if search through enough. Aisles bathroom always clean. New York Chicago products well stocked.

In 2011 even spent over $1000.00 shopping trip pay high quality food own wedding. Glazier's used great store.

Over years Glazier's become MOST EXPENSIVE grocery store Vegas. personally shopped Glazier's Whole Foods find ORGANIC version cheaper Glazier's offers non organic.

Prices only thing changed.

 When walking bouncer Dance Club type greets door. Immediately feel though being watched. 

London Broil sale $2.98 lb. wanted cut half charged last week's price $5.99 lb! did even notice until register where found new store policy if butcher anything other hand piece meat. Hope worked them since register gave back.

One other no no here... wanted bag own groceries.

I worked grocery store kid. am well trained keep perishables together produce together etc.  bagging groceries almost 25 years! told cashier a safety hazard if bag own groceries. new me. Never life told could hurt myself bagging own groceries. If safety hazard would Fresh Easy business now? Surely Health Dept would shut down Winco Food 4 Less well. don't see people grocery stores ground writhing pain bagging own food. 

One other tidbit noticed... sometimes shop 10pm. donuts used 
25¢ each 7pm. anymore. Five minutes before closing pay same if just made. no law says mark down... but just saying... less reason there.
 
Naturally since did bag own groceries home find 3 items same bag... cucumber chicken breast dish soap. 

This good store. drove 10 miles each way visit. However Mr G over extended himself petty policies procedures. He squeezed people ourselves shopping regular basis. Instead Glazier's would recommend Sunflower market soon Sprouts . 

Glazier's still shop 2 3 times year when cravings New York stuff. Otherwise found other places go. Where been? Under rock?  recently drove past Glazier's visiting friend hospital neck woods. intrigued but didn't time stop. mentally made note try sometime.  breakfast Cracked Egg made way shopping center. 

I'd say 85% grocery shopping Fresh Easy because prices but selection isn't great. other 15% usually Smith's Albertson's. Sometimes good sales but kind hit miss. selection decent.  enjoy Whole Foods but prices usually high bit way us. 

As previous reviewer mentioned Glazier's Costco Mariana's Lee's Whole Foods International Marketplace all rolled into one. Before read thought Fresh Easy Whole Foods rolled into one. LOVED selection prices decent. Some items excellent some expected little high organic brands Amy's . 

I definitely back again. actually able eliminate another stop thought going because found exactly needed Glazier's. love fresh produce great selection asian stuff.. worst cases poor quality safety control.  food safe consume? charge all spoiled produce?  Even bag apples where bad shape!! definitely farmers market little no Organic options. Very disgusting!! never return!! brought managements attention. There's no excuse!!! Shawn front supervisor thorough provides diamond standard customer service! absolutely love Pop Chips store sale 2 $1.00.  When returned store 4th July everyone store including other supervisors said familiar product dont them. Today came into store Shawn knew exactly which product wanted told where were. Unbeknownst clearly other staff members chips still available. Thank Shawn! You're amazing! Another local grocery chain kind Vegas version Trader Joes but without own product line far tell. food court which plus.

Prices all over place some good deals some things overpriced just any major grocery store. Service seemed bit more personable but wasn't much couldn't elsewhere though place carries more local smaller brands wasn't enough worth trek across town.

Food court gelato pizza dough nice salad bar ton bakery items. basically HEB grocery chain south Texas just without own branded items. LOVE STORE!

But feel gets hyped people expecting something different. want clear normal grocery store. Whole Foods Trader Joe's. 

The reason why Glazier's because some really good deals lot variety can't find Vons Smith's Albertson's. Hawaiian section Zippy's frozen chili Portugee Sausage ]

They weekly specials often rotate sales produce. seen broccoli cauliflower being sold 98 cents each. similiarly priced Roma Tomatos pound. don't neccesarily best produce ALL time but if every often some really great deals. seen avocados size hand 98 cents each also seen them super tiny $1.98. 

My advice would check weekly specials. 

Everyone working all really friendly. 

I honestly love shopping would recommend people give chance. reading reviews awards place gets very disappointed. excited try premade foods! place overrated big time. spent $74 walked three bags. place completely overpriced. bought tamales authentic Mexican tamales just gross. masa dry cheese chili tamales even real cheese. white cheese whiz there's only sprinkle maybe five six teeny diced tamales. chicken pork same thing. Very dry. bread aisle find hotdog buns Nathan's hot dogs bought. only maybe three four bags left most them expire two days. bought Gino's Chicago style pizza Pastova stuffed shell pasta marinara sauce New York. Let's hope least better! cashier nice. She new. She complaining because things don't ring register properly. Honestly think you're better off going whole foods Trader Joe's if you're going pay high prices food. 10 o'clock morning very slow. Now know why... honestly back here. really different grocery store feels. deli amazing store seems want bring little bit every ones favorite hometown grocery item. Love going place East Coast brands. relatively cheap prices lot prepared meal options. never really satisfied doing whole grocery shopping trip usually only if looking specialty items. Things miss greater Phoenix area 1. AJ's
2. Sprouts
3. Smashboxx
4. select group friends.
5.  it.

Today reading countless mailers Glazier's finally decided drive LOCAL grocery store. Sprouts AJ's all rolled into one.

Thank God because first two list something grew love while Phoenix Scottsdale.

For those don't know...AJ's local high end chain Phoenix area think Whole Foods but smaller nose crowd myself ...and Sprouts similar Trader Joe's but stores much larger.

Ok back Glazier's.

As soon stroll greeted very pristine sales floor. Everything looks immaculate! produce section perfect prices competitive selection great! 

The hot deli section everything knishes pizzas crab cakes even Cincy style chili. Boom.

The meat section...to die for. 

Everything else laid just any other grocery store but rest still just clean perfect entrance.

I am glad store close house. location Henderson if live there.

If read various rags around town you'll notice Glazier's consistently wins Best Grocery Store Las Vegas. reason. place ish.

I can't wait come back! dad decided check place since hearing much good things boy blown away. 

I only once but know coming back. did quick sweep through store however am impressed place clean. when first walked smell aroma store mouth watering smokey flavorful smell grill sweet smell bakery tantalizing. sushi area bakery also already made food side dishes fried chicken. believe saw party platters too! 

On way thoroughly impressed owners supporting local farmers since watermelons selling here! Bravo! am all supporting local produce. 

Since already grocery shopping smiths day before didn't buy anything but did buy some Limes 12 count dollar! Great deal limes ripe picked early. I back then full Review!!! far Thumbs Up! Sadly today decided review horrible experience yesterday. because Blue Bell ice cream sale $3.98. grab vanilla no sugar added chocolate head register. vanilla rings $3.98 NSA chocolate rings $6.99. told cashier must mistake. Another girl checks tells NSA Vanilla sale but chocolate strawberry not????? WTF!!!! just ridiculous. really store but pettiness probably cause shop ever again. hard decide star rating Glazier's. compare very depressing experience shopping Albertsons Vons Smiths. compare Trader Joe's Whole Foods?

Well Glazier's definitely step Albertson's Von's Smith's. inventory variety products huge. find many items can't found elsewhere Las Vegas.  Much cleaner brighter inviting great prices.

However smack dab middle Trader Joes Whole Foods. step Trader Joe's but missing boat when compared whole foods.

Glaziers large regular supermarket lots different things come certain specific items found elsewhere. eat food court if happen hungry when there. But wouldnt special trip eat. prefer food court whole foods leaps bounds. Glazier's Dunkin Donuts Whole Foods Starbucks basically.

If big meat eater large variety meats seafood... Glazier's great meat seafood selection.


Glaziers many grocers continue use but hope turn knotch. More high end exotic foods brands. favorite grocery Las Vegas. salad bar excellent. watch sushi being made store. Boar's Head meats. often see management personnel walking around store keeping eye things. products sometimes hard find west Mississippi. Great store. Nice layout. great store! High quality produce deli butcher shop. fan since opened. cheapest but definitly great locals grocer. staff excellent very helpful. would definitly recommend if southwest.
The owner Mr. G walking store talking staff customers during lot visits. always offer take your grocerys your car staff feel customer number most box stores. going marketplace since first opened far say hired security good all. stopped security people worked he asked white plastic bag placed bottom push cart told toilet tissue body wash. He told kept tightly wrapped saying stern voice. insulted offended rudeness know he just doing job but still rude. just came through front sliding doors marketplace stereo typed quick judgement profiling being klepto maniac.

I later found through relative tagged store security potential shoplifter. said looked suspicious walking down several aisles pissed off found also profiling Asian teenagers
Who caught stealing cosmetic alcohol beverages Glaziers Marketplace

Could imagine surprise walked security guard walked 
Outside where standing saw corner eye police car pulled 
The opposite side grocery store. 

Are totally crazy does Kleptomaniac hang around grocery store 
Purchase fully pay items...

I said myself may young looking but am certainly teenager. felt offended
And disguisted clouded judgement am boycotting glaziers marketplace.
There better markets then one. Again different grocers fulfill different needs. find glaciers best meat seafood counter impressive. Chicken breasts always lowest price town. Some specialty items perk your interest hint'o flavor sparkling water zero calories no artificial sweetner sugar sold front check out. dieters dream beverage! love deli counter w free samples buy some cold cuts some cheese free specials. other weekly specials good packs stuffed ravioli which feed two $1.00. great see Mr Glacier zipping around store customer service helpful friendly. However where fun ends deli bakery items mediocre taste very high priced produce only lasts day  selection slim go albertsons best choices two week fridge life . aside weekly specials overall food prices high watch your wallet. best specialty food grocery store town! come Vienna beef hotdog Italian beef fix! absolutely love grocery store. amazing produce reasonable price. Some other items little pricy buts worth it. grocery store reminds back home.  salad bar AHmazing.  variety things purchase store awesome well.  cheap wine isn't shabby either.  organic produce variety items back east staff all very friendly.  suggest try cheap cheese pizza Wednesday quite tasty.  haven't tried sorbet but looking gets salivary glands going.  yourself favor stop by. BEST GROCERY STORE EXISTANCE!     Staff always willing extra mile if dont something want tell them! stock next time come in..   only place town buy Drake's Baked goods untill Hostess business.. fan!!

The prices great fairly large selection gluten free items. usually head few way places when town stock some goods. Glazier's quite bit usual items buy soy sauce Amy's Cedar Lane frozen products. 

Produce Great prices. However think its hit miss. seen better but prices just sure consume perhaps day of. 

Gelato Counter Really gelato counter. Even cold day its always nice scoop gelato enjoy trip

Deli Counter Tons freshly prepared items salads. Including sesame noodle salad some East Coast favs white fish salad chicken liver salad.
Boars Head deli meats.

Refrigerated Cases Tons cheeses. Including some specialty cheeses drunken goat cheese. Then sections into cusines tamales looked great marinated olives fresh pastas sauces.

Rotisserie They flavor wanted but friends lemon garlic.

Wine Great selection. even someone sampling wine. 

Then standard groceries prices great. way its stop shop me. that?!? cashier assured debit card WOULD charged twice find did fact charged twice posted account next day . 

I know registers time out. done that. work retail happened know fact CHARGE PERSON TWICE. She didn't offer call supervisor manager but against better judgment left. 

I filed dispute bank hopefully money returned timely manner. 

Glazier's management Ensure your cashiers properly trained handle all types situations if cannot give them tools necessary ensure customer satisfaction top priority. chose call your establishment because felt if didn't care if shopped your store then wouldn't care if gave back $60. some $60 chump change but work hard money $60 could use gas money food family. RUDEST employees EVER! came looking Tahini tk hummus. getting no where mybown decided ask young girls stocking shelves. When asked she didn't even turn around acknowledge just asked some SERIOUS attitude that? meanest look face. told never mind find own. which she replied just asking. that? just told she being rude didnt need attitude walked away. saw another worker asked which she replied aisle 10. Didnt take time show just kept doing she doing. Looked all down aisle 10 couldnt find it. saw young man few aisles over also stocking shelves asked him. He also didn't seem know looking but seemed he going more helpful. Wrong! explained he took Asian section. When he said Um really sure just look aisle 10 again? Seriously? Strike 3 said screw check out. lady self check asked she didn't know. check another checker she didn't know either. But least cashier helpful. She didn't know but said where she thought would but then tell don't carry anymore. 

Will NEVER shop EVER again. Unbelievable UNHELPFUL rude several employees were. No knowledge products also asked where polenta again didn't know. carry several brands don't know is? 

HORRIBLE! Would recommend anyone. sell more specialty items brands but buy online elsewhere. many parts Glazier's Food Marketplace cafe bakery grocery store etc. but review grocery store itself.

When first moved into area year ago Glazier's offered refreshing exciting grocery shopping experience. store very clean spacious offered wide selection ready to eat food grocery items. Items decently priced some really good deals throughout store. But months shopping came realize there's plenty missing shopping experience caused back shopping places such Vons Smith's Wal Mart.

I did some price comparisons items bought Glazier's both Vons Wal Mart. Chances you'll save least 15% if shop other stores. Don't wrong Glazier's some really great deals you'll see every now then but when comes regular priced items places such Wal Mart them quite margin.

There also seems lot items missing. Whether trying find selection healthy bars trying something recipe you'll struggle plenty times find you're looking for. Because Glazier's isn't one stop shop you'll most likely need go to another store anyways.

Last but least customer service! Whenever someone does talk greet always friendly exchange. But is... whenever someone does which almost never. If ever need help you'll probably speak someone working deli cashier which isn't ideal.

I still go to Glazier's Food Marketplace every now then but ideal choice grocery shopping. love place! east coast transplant missed lot snacks brands there. When first walked greeted delicious aroma hand tossed pizza. ventured further into store came across table full tasty cakes drakes cakes. Both junk food staples youth. entire section chips aisle dedicated wise potatoe chips. entire aisle dedicated Hispanic foods Goya reminded old bodegas back home. thing holds them back getting 5 stars prices. some great deal produce area but general merchandise little high end much Vons which u guess still bad considering Vons hundreds stores Glaziers only one . produce dept. terrible smells produce fresh soft soggy questionable quality.
cashier # 717 very rude ask question your treated idiot!!!
i find new grocery store shop !!! don't recommend all !!!    
terrible customer service. never saw many unhappy employee's life....... Sad. Glazier used decent. Now awful. Produce nasty. Rotten. person even gotten paper plate put few moldy rotten tomatoes it. Even though saw employees produce department no ever took away. Prices sky high! ad tries say they've lowered hundreds prices! Not! know there's problem right there! home made sausage tastes nasty. advertise certain seafood Hawaiian. But named seafood doesn't exist Hawaii! sure exists anywhere! False advertising! But when ask seafood counter employees just give blank stare!  when walk store don't come back. employees don't even know selling! Omg! Scary! obviously friends family stuffing ballot box store voted Best each year. grabbed few things gave up. checked told Courtney cashier rotten produce. She asked if wanted speak customer service. did walked past desk. girl dyed red hair. She very nice said she would tell someone. produce only. gone before 3 months ago. produce then rotten bugs flying around it. ventured give try again see if any improvements. sadly did find improvement produce section. still rotten badly bruised. frozen pasta's NY Italian cookies best! don't much more because pricey. chocolate donuts best town! also red velvet donuts which definitely going again. Glazier's sells HUGE pizza great price. liked enough back two days later. Come grocery store... lots grocery stores Vegas right??? Well.... sense yes... But love Glazier's many different options other grocery stores don't carry. 

The fruit selection always great. pick through them but quality price awesome! yet disappointed especially love some apples selection apples amazing!! 

I also love pre made items. tried many different types pre made items disappointed. Bolognese yummy pasta could've soggy sitting sauce but amazingly pasta keeps texture good chew. stuffed cabbage very good very meaty. could've skimped meat but didn't flavor tomato sauce really balanced. stuffed shells also delicious. ricotta filling best ricotta fillings had.  Cincinnati chili other hand little disappointing. little greasy side enough chili imho. Cheese tortellini also only ok well. 

And oh yeah favorite bialys!!! cross between bagel English muffin... found freezer section good shipped frozen NY. yummy! cannot find anywhere else. 

And opened till midnight 7 days week well. love selection raw meats pre cooked items. great deli area uses boar's Head... sandwiches just buy meat slice right there. 

They pretty much everything looking for. kind whole foods IMHO without prices. Very affordable much healthier then eating junk food night which only thing open midnight. Something's worth driving for. What's  big deal Glaziers? locally owned family east coast. such variety different foods across country fun grocery trip. Real New York bagels all sorts goodies. if you're mood cooking something too. huge area freshly prepared meals two. produce ok.. prices good bad depending buy. Pto even cooked steak dinner Friday nights. Food thought... vendor grocery stores years. back rooms most would horrify you.  Glaziers without doubt cleanest store valley. ground beef store ground trim  IMPORTANT if care eat. find things never big 3 chains Walmart. Sure little more expensive but health more important saving few bucks. Also give back community big way. Mr Mr G seen walking around store often making sure things right. happy them community can't wait new store open Green Valley area next year! check Bear Claws bakery!! city filled supermarket chain stores Glazier's welcome change.

For most part grocery area pretty standard although several specialty items shelves.  deli meat area also pre made meals sides like mashed potatoes example much better comparable items other grocery stores.  also great selection cheeses well salad bar.

In addition standard grocery store fare also food counter several different stations where ice cream freshly made pizza fresh deli sandwiches.  There's other station but can't remember serve there.

They also great weekly specials including some sort family meal deal.  deal meant feed four people usually includes some sort meat like roast enough veggies side two some rolls or something comparable .  usually very good deal.

I don't think Glazier's replace typical supermarket just yet but very good store well worth checking out. beautiful store lots interesting product but most all love bakery. grocery part sorta high priced but other then love place. deli always tempting tons tons bake goods. 

So pretty much yelping bakery guess. before never really shopped groceries but but would come food pastries. day daughters dedication Church Mother's Day Sunday didn't want drive all way Patisserie Manon all way Bocca park being live SW only hour before ceremony begins Suzuya Pastries Crepes ran cakes my bad cause didn't order ahead remember wait second Glaziers should something nice....and did which turn even better because drop $50 $60 bucks cake spent $18 delicious beautiful cake! 

The ladies nice did great job fitting wanted written cake looked perfect. cake itself moist sweet but sweet enough fruit topping cream filling just right. Hey lucked day Glaziers thank that! love place.  Fresh fruit vegetable.  Great Grocery Store.  Friendly Service.  Very Big Clean! Fish counter smelled something died...awhile ago. Cashier extremely rude manager when credit card machine issues. no idea voted top grocery store. Save yourself bad experience somewhere else. Came because all positive reviews but wouldn't way there...The prices aren't great everyone seemed is...for prepared foods Sunflower Market Fresh Easy also Geri's Old Philadelphia Pecos Tropicana also sells bunch East Coast Favorites Tastykake Wise Chips Drakes stuff that...Only thing mom would probably Glazier's pork roll...But living Sandhill Hacienda plenty choices where price compare plenty stores same East Coast selection...Its good SW now choice other expensive VONS always busy Wal Mart... want love store. isn't any reason why shouldn't. everything love. can't even list all things love because just many. list thing made stop shopping Customer Service. 
We Boars Head family. only lunch meat eat. Glaziers really beautiful deli super easy convenient kiosk ordering. stocked everything could ever want. Except staff knows slice superior product. cheese consistently dirty. Meaning see remnants last cheese sliced all over cheese  same thing happened ham...remnants roast beef all over it. cheese never nicely sliced separated wax time home all slices kinda just molded into lump. Impossible separate without tearing. If order something sliced thin very thin shouldn't bag full thick slabs meat. ordered 'very thin' salami thick would think joke. happened often just Smith's Boars Head. But every once while stop Glaziers give deli another chance. always ends total disappointment. love amazing bakery but sadly never anyone back slice bread. said many things love market would keep coming back more but there's just thing keeps away basic customer service. back forth between Glazier's Vons. 

The employees always very helpful friendly. mostly come buy meats because there's significant price difference department. also come buy Blue Bell moo bars can't enough them they're only store neighborhood carries them. good selection items but small produce section sometimes good deals but still prefer produce across street same price lazy drive across Glazier's ha! 

Food court pizza amazing slices huge pizza itself thin crispy. also bakery deli which nice but never actually purchased anything Glazier's bit overpriced but sometimes really good specials. Glaziers but... morning stopped donut coffee 8am.  donut service counter cup coffee.  No there.  individual around.  asked greeter door.  He checked around found person charge coffee counter break... 8am... prime time coffee hour.  What's worse fourth time happened.  Needless say left store empty handed.  don't time patience deal lack service that.

I can't believe allow business operate that.  Glaziers needs take look staff behaving.

UNACCEPTABLE! quality Meat's. Love when ask product LISTEN stock!!! started shopping getting tired frustrated local Smiths Albertsons area.  Glaziers where other grocery stores lack customer service.  Glazier also carries some East coast mid west Brands such Nathans Vienna Beef.  Try Glaziers if live Southwest part Las Vegas Valley you'll never waste time again another grocery store. Glazier's good but there's room improvement. 

The good Employees generally sharp helpful. There's better buzz air you'll find typical chain store. Good prices produce usually great sale item two. 

The bad remove your backpack when enter unless you're lucky enough draw security guard doesn't notice . don't know if best loss prevention technique because sort just admits someone backpack could lot damage. I'd prefer Glazier's take more holistic approach step camera game whatever tactic may allow honest denizens maintain possession personal items while shop.

Typically shop across street major corporate conglomerate just Glazier's when there's particular item need. I'd pick Glazier's every time if wasn't backpack thing.

Four stars could've three. very impressed only short time.  all kinds things haven't seen other grocery stores seemed quite reasonably priced. Moreover clean well organized.  blown away food court area well bakery variety fritters.  didn't much time shop but really liked did see!  return! favorite grocery store!! many things home Illinois . new happy place!! Glaziers constantly getting voted best Las Vegas but don't know why. selection decent produce deli meats but beyond regular grocery store. isn't cleanest all places prices aren't cheapest. would Smith's over Glaziers 7 7 days week. Rating supermarket hard y'all.  bullet points minus actual bullet points.   


Veggies sometimes fresh.  
Prices little higher other supermarkets most items.  
They more unique items most supermarket....   it.  
I really enjoy seafood.  Shrimp fish always fresh well priced.  
Chicken better price other places but many those squishy prices hate chicken temporarily.  
Eggs super tasty inexpensive. 

That's it.  certain items know enough other items elsewhere.  But nice vibe it.   Lots things only Glazier.   Clean nice employers interesting walk around see have. client   place since opened doors. Friendly  place. Nice owner. says hello when he sees you. Prices bad general just keep your eyes open ...like any other market may higher prince product two. Shop smart love place. prepared foods bit pricey side. Otherwise. love  yet chain corporations. Just simple local family run owned store. Today terrible experience favorite store. 
KIM cashier store terrible unrespectable Rude. upset manager involved. when left son told upset she just hates white people .
This really SAD. excited find market Best Vegas banner outside. very large market but almost everything overpriced. premade food available deli expensive eating fast casual restaurant. seafood double price say WinCo 3 4 times more ethic market.

So if just overpriced market wouldn't spend time write review however customer service really irked me. When check noticed Jalapeno mustard rung wrong price $3.25 instead $2.99. $0.26 you're thinking isn't big deal right? But mustard last meaning sell lot many times overcharged customers that. many other items ringing wrong prices? all adds up.

We back aisle double check price yup $2.99. tell same cashier checked happened. She said she can't anything ask manager. manager could bothered she said she busy something else. cashier flagged someone else down  the son or son in law? owner. He made most annoyed face when cashier told check price. He came back confirmed cashier never acknowledging apologizing mistake .

So now expecting $0.26 back. Instead cashier rings asks $2.99. tell already paid need refund. She then says oh ok over self serve check customer service help you. WTF? Why can't just open your register give quarter sort later?

Forget only $0.26 now time wasted BS worth it. She's telling stand another line now? leave she YELLS customer service help us.  Never did even person ever say sorry mix up.

Oh when WinCo rings item wrong price know do? give FREE. stopped into Glaziers today brief work meeting craving spicy shrimp salad. saw older Asian woman assisted scooping packaging 1lb into small plastic container. told greatly appreciated continued checkout line when saw awesome strawberries looked! did basket because only expecting grab salad. adjusting hands carry both items salad slipped plastic container cracked down side allowing maybe 3 shrimp fall floor. 

I backpedaled salad section said same Asian woman sorry slipped hands... before could another word Asian woman's eyes darted older white woman long grey hair gathered net threw arms into air shouted Well WHERE DID SPILL. continued tell just over produce.. she cut off said Well  lot little. *again throwing arms air* told very little. never seen someone frustrated over spilt salad! if ruined whole day!  

I did calmly tell wouldn't mind paying it.

She continued pointing baskets saying why don't they're right one. Giving directive if she teacher school reprimanding perfect accident. 

At point even offered clean spill which she turned back SHOOK head NO continuously if couldn't see her. thought she mental break. 

All attitude over spilt salad? never felt unwelcome place business. 

Who woman why she miserable sassy customers.... Furthermore why does she think okay wear inconveniences sleave?

Tossing hands shouting reprimanding turning back shaking head disapproval me. does she think she is? 

I smiled polite entirety interaction. understand may suck may pick few shrimp floor why sass? EVEN offered myself least pay it. 

.... Asian woman finally handed new salad without word continued check where did express spilled salad again offered clean up. also expressed interaction woman supervisor very polite. am usually person speak manager but thrown off experience someone could upset over salad felt need to.    I enjoy Glaziers extremely fresh produce fish poultry. also value other workers store give great assistance seem very cleanly. 

If run into woman forget getting yourself some fresh salad keep moving! Okay don't even know where start because store really incredible. If you've lived Las Vegas awhile then sure you've traveled vacationed other places only return home wonder yourself why don't any those cool things ____ well now finally those places!  

     Glazier's Food Marketplace aside freakin' cool also those things city need quite some time. midst all typical chain grocery stores Smith's Albertsons Vons ther never really anything stood before which Glazier's breath fresh air.

     When first walk door see rows fresh produce directly front but turn your left immediately see store different. open market style feel fresh pizza deli gelatto bar fresh coffee sushi other fish. Turn your right self serve salad bar plethora toppings. Walking towards back bakery your left full service deli salad counter your right huge sausage ad meats counter back all kinds fresh cuts. Next seafood counter wide selection even steam your crab free! Just before your last turn right head grocery isles deli meats cheese counter tops list. order your sandwhich meats cheeses first walk kisok choose want much touch screen submit your order prints reciept take along order number choose text when your order complete! If decide wait while work screens tell which four stations working your order watch your meats sliced fresh! nice busy people wait counter all night someone no idea want because most time consuming part process moved kiosk. Best idea ever grocery store. wraps open market syle area classy neon signs along walls seating area live piano playing while bite eat.

     down rest grocery isles tell much wider selection things wouldn't find typical grocery store. All kinds specialty items unique hard find chocolate soda lol. prices some things little higher other stores but cannot prices fresh food. Glazier's rows rows fresh in house prepaired food take home use finsh. pastries section unrivaled selection price. best part all when time came check all 8 checklanes open four more express self checkout lanes bringing total 12. often see ANY store 100% checklanes open? Yeah.

     could literally ramble all day amazing grocery but all really say check yourself. When sure leave yourself plenty time wonder through store. guranteed find something love but giver yourself time see all. didn't enough time take all though already can't wait back check again. 24 miles house Centennial Hills but plan making trip frequently know worth it. city lucky such wonderful local store shop food. very unique place everyone city missing if don't go. Thank opening Mr. Mrs. Glazier retirement overrated anyway lol. Goodness gracious! love Glazier's. gelato excellent customer service meat department complain. carry varieties produce products even own isle Naked juice. = Their pricing expensive seems neat every time come in. seafood area ahi poke! Ahh am heaven lol. hungry store know want time out. If ever feel Southern Nevada become synonymous Eastern California saying necessarily bad thing but know... trip Glazier's may your back east antidote.

Glazier's neighbourhood grocery store stocking all those items expect find big chains Albertsons Smith's Vons. difference though Glazier's enthusiastically offers ever growing selection seldom see round New York favourites. don't remember all brands expect Tastykakes but know stop reading food column newspaper. Half requests people could fulfilled just trip Glazier's. Almost every aisle signs Straight Bronx!  A New York classic! baptized Big Appleness when shop time reach checkout lane standing line.

Also distinguishing Glazier's pack small food court gorgeous grand piano but don't feel area gets much use. you'll see pretty lemonade kind weak time tried it gelato smoothies Boar's Head sandwiches I may vegetarian but look heartily appetizing something extremely sanitary Renaissance fair rotisserie sausages New York style pizza always weekly special but Grimaldi's just down road so... but most people seem stuff piano rarely plays.  okay having having stay spell culture corner store doesn't really affect happy am when selecting plum.

Nearby salad bar sold pound sushi section items same place everyone else seems sushi bakery baguettes some artisan loaves tend dense few things found elsewhere very thinly sliced French bread . Glazier's only store town know stocks both kinds eclairs kind custardy filling kind whipped sugary filling. If you've ever no real eclair battle then appreciate Glazier's offering.

Across bakery packaged dishes cheddar mashed potatoes fettucini corn relish on. can't say done much seem more expensive similar offerings Fresh Easy. best person judge though since rarely see anything want. deli case all kinds salads even electronic kiosk pre ordering but again nothing really begged come home us. lines counter would say ours less common experience though. 

Glazier's usually cheese two sampling which learned wonderful Kerrygold Dubliner well Australian Boxing Cheddar. Also samples usually some kind doughnut. Glazier doughnuts become incredibly cheap 7 p.m.. Tastewise I'd say they're fresher more carefully prepared Winchell's road but flavourful Dee's across corner. But since Dee's always closes early worse Glazier's fare. The vegetarian organic natural international selections little more varied usual chains. Hispanic items come down usual novena candles maybe some spices don't always see elsewhere. Jewish section very strong at least shiksa eye .

The produce area may look small first but never unable find something. Last week bonniest tomatillos probably ever seen life. 

As enter store passing two Redboxes vending machine stocks fluttery heart! Yoohoo sure pick flyer. Every week Glaziers gives two things free purchase over $25 usually something useful lettuce aluminum foil. When leave traditional checkout self checkout. No loyalty cards required. *high five sky*

Guess found Glazier's last week? mean other fact locally made Joe's Cola back stock ASAP. Speaking which Glazier's great fulfilling requests. discovered several new products requested signs aisles course now don't Whole Foods Joe's. learned Glazier's donates ALL its profits sale pet products help local abandoned animals. Yes 100%. If buy your Milkbones Glazier's you're helping Las Vegas critters. Now just need ask Glazier's start stocking Hartz hamster mix. There's no single grocery store city country? world? everything want but feels good shop Glazier's. There's customer conscious vibe spacious quiet feel price selection right. let's forget pets. Woof! Boom boom boom let hear say wayyoooh way oh. 

After three years stalling coming place finally bit bullet. damn time! sure why waited long especially since they've won best grocery store three years.

Loved organized store is. large but small town grocery feel. Three workers asked if could help which great. never happens smiths albertsons. Time change! 

Noticed lots different food can't other markets. Chips Chicago pizza flown Italy. Special food Hawaii. nice such variety. 

Prices average little more expensive. noticed couple items cheaper. Buy free. Some fresh produce. Fresh baked items. guess just really need pay attention prices ad. 

Loved pre made meals near deli. many options lunches quick dinners. Anywhere mothers cooking Mexican salsas hummus. 

They deli good priced fresh subs made order deli where fresh pizzas right front where pick toppings gelato bar. many options little time. could spend some serious money if given chance. 

If lived closer would come more often. def see what's great place now. most awesome breakfast ever. Service great staff fun very accommodating. placed order breakfast burrito received coffee told sweet cashier going gamble would back. She actually took time stop tell she just put order down additional time play. Finished playing food ready ate nice clean patio area. Great tasting wonderful portion size! Glaziers good gets opinion.  every week groceries sometimes between quick stop something need.  place ultra friendly employees customer service pro's.  Best part place?  Mr G. glazier seen daily pushing shopping cart around store.  cool owner store says hi thanks you?  Coming Vegas very small town MA learn appreciate rare occurances personalized service.  Glaziers everything need see no reason anywhere else. deli wonderful well East Coast foods. However confusion check no assist carrying groceries your car. am someone over 65 spends more $150 per week market but flustered upset when bag check most time then empty your cart into your vehicle. Every time finished scenario see young man outside pushing carts back into store. What's lack service? Please look into because don't want change super markets but may due problem. supermarket pretty awesome. When walk immediately smell baked goods bakery. Everyone works friendly. nice see Mr. Glazier walking around all time making sure everything going well. great selection products if want something stocked request it. Afraid won't your request? Don't be. work hard stock. If really pay attention some foods see labels say REQUESTED ITEM tons those. tons different prepared foods take home huge salad bar. Prices vary cheapest but most expensive. probably neatest supermarkets seen. enjoy going place because offer variety Hawaii international products throughout store just small section most store carry Hawaii international products. more relaxing environment then albertson smith vons. late night score 24 donuts couple dollars usually $1 2 piece most places. good selection seafood meat beer. fresh vegetables. already made individual meals awesome better frozen package meals. Added star fresh large pizza $8.99 special  freshly made oven cooked.  

It very good!! rudest owner ever met life. Non union well rude disrespectful. definitely never shop here. Love market!  No. 1 Union!  No. 2 well stocked items cannot find anywhere else.  No. 3 clean people very pleasant.  Having moved Commifornia being used markets attest fact Glaziers surpasses those market long shot.  truly wonderful shopping experience. live near market but shopping anymore. produce meats etc. fresh but found other supermarkets.  drove away attitude employees. asked cashier if she product looking for.  She simply said don't know .  asked check.  She manager manager also said don't know !  box boy rude but simply ignored me.  first time happened so....No thanks Mr Glazier shop elsewhere. bad owners rude judge mental. really loved shopping here. used shop least 2 4 times per week! nasty encounter owner. funny shopped often finally noticed when approached taking more FREE magazines front entrance! Really?!?!? NEVER step foot your overpriced store again. Ever! place may cost bit more most grocery stores but quality food unbeatable. pay classic example that. even actual New York Bagels Bronx. tire stores clean everyone extremely polite friendly. asked numerous times if needed help anything which actually appreciate. Overall great place shop if money it. place being back NY. Best meat seafood selection town. love ready made foods bakery.  son love buying pizza dough making own pizza home. Always special time. huge fan sauce own but all all.... amazing! really can't say enough good things place but put few them idea. I'm cab driver Las Vegas just every supermarket specialty store love cook.  quality products Glazier's amazing while some prices may just little higher if check weekly ad you'll find more enough things balance your shopping budget splurge really great items.

Glazier's weird habit taking customer's recommendations bring those items AWESOME right? .  tell which ones tags showing new item which requested.  haven't yet found need request any particular item quite sure doing but sure very helpful attentive staff knows how.

They lot items can't generally find other stores including UNOs frozen pizzas full assortment Tastykake Drake's snack cakes decent Hawaiian section well other things frozen whole duck brick Scrapple.

This your regular grocery store even if way definitely worth going to.  live almost 10 miles away drive least once week! really Glazier's. don't really shopping big chain grocery stores because boyfriend used work he would tell all questionable things save money... being said thing love store wide unique item selections. many things would find usual grocery store weird brands never seen before different flavors things tons random beers beverages. 

Their food court pre made meal section service counters awesome! always hungry want buy everything while walking through part store. Oh meat department massive! many different cuts beef wide variety fish even poke tuna! eyes big when see cheese section.... drool. 

The prices might little higher some item but doesn't bother all. Paying quality always okay me. would say probably come if your budget but if you're then check out! Basically only thing say grocery store! BEST! deli bakery meat dept. best ever come across. everything deli themselves. meat dept biggest selection house made sausage. very good!! 

Now since Las Vegas such big melting pot people coming all areas USA beyond really reconize carry lots hometown brands. really nice when find stuff noone else town carries but know its special because its your hometown state.

Also place amazinly clean. store 25 miles way house but only find shopping experience Glazier's well worth drive. Check 'em yourselves! confident love them also!! first time Glazers nice experience!  Exceptional seafood great prices vegetables wine.  Anthony cashier informative customer oriented.  don't live close Glazers but  where shopping now on. Love deli salad bar. place good Asian section also. SoCal eaters limited truly healthy options i.e gluten free section small.  local organic GMO nitrate free limited.  cannot find Vegan ramen typical preservative free chemical free Whole foods Sprouts style foods here.  However if need red cancer causing meats freshly made icky Beef Pork other animal meats fresh.  sausage area impressively designed cancer fearless beef eaters.  cheese area PolyO heart attack waiting cheeses.  If miss east coast style fattening foods sure heavy weight your grocery store.  prefer SoCal free range non GMO local organic stay away here.  But NJ friends love being fat love place.  specifically import NJ NY Chicago specialty brand foods.  Canoli shells gluten laden pastries processed deli meats canola toxic oil all waiting those wanting seek medical care often. Can't believe stopped Glaziers since area again couple absent years. getting couple produce items into dreaded deli section. wife wanted some fresh salsa picked pico del gallo salsa roja. Now home she opens pico gallo asks if opened check it. said no why? NO plastic seal under lid looked dried out. Besides without protective seal knows happen if someone did open contaminated it. Then she opens salsa Roja just horrible! call quality food? worth driving back across town complain management. already know could care less. 
There comment baked goodies sold here. Well if look closer ingredients 95% oil used desserts partially hydrogenated oil it. Majority chocolate used clog ur artery oil Glaziers. 
My wife threaten if ever back come home junkie food look another place live ! Yikes ! Glaziers waste time money. won't back ever. Found real deli Vegas. Great friendly courtious staff truly aim your shopping experience enjoyable. Thanks.
Give them pay raise deserve it. Ordered large turkey tom dinner 16 18lbs yams potatoes corn. Picked opened box find small dry 10lb turkey no yams no stuffing. 

I called let them know told ran yams but substitute more gravy something? Well turkey? paid large now stuck dinky turkey. 

Brought dinky turkey back store manager said given wrong turkey he proceeded back grab larger turkey. He apologized he said workers just putting whatever boxes people orders. Ok feel lot better. ordering again. Upscale slightly more expensive would compare Hagan's Pacific Northwest Foodland Hawaii.

The aisles wide store really clean. even able find some poke which wasn't bad . lady behind counter also Hawaii. She Eh wea u frum? Funny everyone changes proper mainland English pidgin once think see Locals. struck nice pidgin conversation her. 

Anyway found most stuff needed dinner night here. poke bonus.

There's plenty parking front. place highway robbery. prices high guess pay rent area. else where buy cheaper food. place very clean nice whole foods but price forget it. butcher area joke. just package meat. Tried ordering some meat told fridge area. sigh. little things other stores don't carry but necessary. Also don't blue chips. Meanwhile 4 dozen other chips but don't blue chips Grr. But some sales ok here. Love store! Lots fresh produce items other markets don't sell. Its pretty large store every time its clean. breads muffins pizza all good but best cake ordered daughters 1st grade class. placed order 2 days before told lady wanted paid. Only 34 bucks special order sheet cake. When came back pick cake much better thought going turn out!! really cant say enough. hour later all dig in. cake moist whipped topping just right sweet but over bearing. most definitely place cakes! Best grocery store Vegas!  really far house lucky if once every month two.  reason first time because heard carry Jay's potato chips Chicago.  didn't them stock but fell love store.  great deli.  love order kiosk text when your order ready.  seafood meat section awesome.  6 kinds bacon!  own bacon flight!  everything Chicago dogs poppy seed bun celery salt everything between.  If homesick Chicagoan check them out.  also carry Green River soda few different frozen deep dish pizzas Uno's Lou Malnatis etc.  frozen pizzas weren't great but happy them try.  love grocery store.  wish would open Henderson. Ok love unique items can't just anywhere.  great deli counter fresh made sandwiches.  huge fan produce section all seemed old somewhat wilted.  Careful if buying alcohol person line front buying alcohol.  If your cashier under 21 she can't check replacement check take LONG time.  Kinda annoying but sign says can't buy alcohol...just look sign.  take special orders which nice.  ordered case rhubarb dad.  called when all pay.  Very nice order things bulk .  European dad pleased canned immediately! Bad customer service. almost feel bad doing store. Sucks here! see why Glazier's voted favorite neighborhood grocery several consecutive years. most if all you'd need. Fresh produce perfectly cut meats deli in house bakery gelato! Yes gelato. could easily spend 2 hours going around around there. 

And walking there's always security welcomes stiff militant type. favorite part when walking smell bakery. Mmmmm bread!

The staff remain attentive very knowledgeable. happy Southwest more just Albertson's Vons. also products Hawaii.  probably favorite part its complete stop
shop me. prices tad higher chain grocers but take freshness quality over cheap any day. think prices some products bit more expensive compared other grocery stores but wide selection international foods! produce bit cheaper but every day items paper towels cleaners say stick other stores. 

All all back pick some more stuff just every day materials. Mexican markets produce bit cheaper but if you're looking stop shop isn't bad either! closest grocery store house new go to when food emergency. really excited browse store because remembered used buy dirt cheap sweet potatoes when making baby food. produce excellent good quality great price. HOWEVER.... mostly everything else more expensive Wal Mart. don't generic brand cheapo love generic when comes things easily generic ie sliced cheese canned anything cereal. 

The prices comparable Albertsons definitely lower Vons across street. ad front store basket coupon bottom if spend more $25 you'll something random. Last week bunch celery something actually needed week 6 Campbells Tomato Chicken Noodle soups. reach $25 limit cannot include dairy products total ended being $23.80 since count Almond milk dairy knew . All all bad new neighborhood grocery store. Why didn't find place sooner?!  many speciality items deli fresh food produce diverse prices way lower expected.  love pineapple fritter bakery good fresh green chile chicken tamales didn't even through store entirely big!  Very unique items don't find chain markets even Whole Foods Trader Joes well worth trip drive. Love glaziers. food all time but Monday October 19th around 7pm girlfriend ceaser shrimp salad bar. Worst food poisoning ever. 8 hours expelling everything. If enjoy fire hosing your butt stay clear salad bar. often take extra time drive Glaziers because quality meat selection produce selection specialty foods.  Prices comparable major chains opinion just keep eye non grocery pricing but buy elsewhere anyhow love store put order deli computer continue your shopping pick when you're done. No waiting line deli. Also lot finds don't see other grocery stores. Only gave 4 stars because only once. looking organic food market other Wholefoods Glazier's check out. Well well basically Winco quality type food WF prices....

They small organic gluten free section some imported stuff Goya brand reminded Jon's market LA... The place modern new funky smell all over store....

Definitely looking for. Glazier's three times each time found old expired food items. last time bought something sick food. . employees rude. would shop again. if rude employees old expired food then place you. cook lot frequent neighborhood grocery stores lot....Glaziers really close house next petco another place visit ALOT   always everything need despite fact tht its massive sized store butcher meat area especially nice nice if cook alot alays whole fish not just flimsy filet's cut something special if size cut want already out.The staff very friendly helpful. Also they're sandwiches verrrry good bf addicted them while. far prices find its cheaper when shop only other place Smith's same reasons. grocery store steroids. Move over Trader Joe's Whole Foods. There's new champion town!

Glazier's all...literally. mood New York bagel nova lox? Done. bout delicious pulled pork sandwich? No problem. selection homemade oven or microwave ready foods staggering. anything Mexican enchiladas pico de gallo Italian pasta sauces stuffed pastas etc . 

There's magnificent selection homemade sausages beautiful fresh cuts beef pork fish. overwhelmed while shopping here...I also very hungry not good idea . wanted EVERYTHING. Even soda selections impressive a plethora flavors Jones Virgil's many more .

The good thing place compared Whole Foods Trader Joe's if want just regular stuff i.e. Oscar Meyer it. feel could hours talking place but won't bore you. think picture. Check place out.

Only complaint location?! Come Henderson Glazier's! great place shop family store people friendly but great things Philly steak unbelievable price can't Philly if chance also people  sandwich very friendly  hard come nowadays way see special hamburgers  next thing going try Great selection HORRIBLE customer service.

Firstly going Glaziers since first opened. abundance East Coast brands well foreign brands love. appreciate diversity food lavash cannolis. However past 3 years rarely Glaziers actually dread going but offer some brands only find such Herrs. 

Why? am FREQUENTLY stereotyped shoplifter boyfriend. both young 21 22 year old UNLV students typically spend more $100 per shopping trip. Yet trailed Glaziers workers shop making uncomfortable. Imagine shopping people following your every move. bf bought Aquafina water bottle into store as its hot outside remain hydrated employee accused stealing it. told he could check cameras clearly see bf walked water bottle disgusting . 

Additionally staff rude almost every counter. Today older woman working self checkout accused having fake ID when purchasing alcohol. She said why license picture way referring vertical picture because she used seeing horizontal . appalled told contact NV legislature NV DMV if she concerned. did time explain license renewal procedure recently turned 21. Honestly ignorance attitude employees offensive. 

If find some brands Glaziers elsewhere will. amazing grocery store.  moving near Glaziers trying once knew hooked.  brought handful east coast awesomeness Vegas.  Drakes Cakes half sour pickles fresh donuts made right store.  even picked some frozen raviolis made small NY restaurant awesome.  am angry some union picketing place when all employees inside friendly appear enjoy work.  started facebook page plan very large colorful signs encouraging patrons shop Glaziers plan YouTube try big deal needless oppression directed great business. Nice grocery store along same lines bristol farms gelsons socal.

6$ large cheese pizzas weekdays actually great NY style thin crust.

It's best grocery store vegas decent margin.  Stocked similar all high end organic grocers but everything complete ripoff there.  

Great deli butcher shop area.  Lots pre prepared dishes take home.

It only gets four stars because instead putting store many vacant locations more central Las Vegas put outskirts town.

You actually see california border parking lot. More manager boxes inventory two front public booths seating area piano salad bar. Nice new big grocery store corner Durango Warm Springs. seafood selection impressive. lot Whole Foods but cheaper. Prices seem par cheaper Vons Smith's but wider variety quality produce. gripe deli. Smith's they'll ask want your meat cut give first slice taste. asked lady slice thin. She sliced off amount requested stuck bag w showing me. back place saw wasn't sliced thin all. Disappointing but big deal guess. also looking creme fraiche but didn't any head down Fresh Easy pick some up. Still seem stuff other big box stores like Vons Albertson's don't have.

I read local paper The Southwest View place real mom n pop operation. run Bill Helen Glazier formerly retired couple owned few other grocery stores Philly. article said plans open Glazier's Henderson summer 2010. grocery store.  brand new clean staff friendly.  shop circulars little way wouldn't all grocery needs.

They different Family Meal Deal every week which pretty cool.  example Buy 3 pounds ground beef $10 buns bottle water salad canned vegetable free.

They also store coupons random free items $25 purchase week large cantaloupe 64 ounce bottle apple juice.

They pretty extensive ready to eat hot food stations well nice seating area eat market.  Off top head coffee station ice cream pizza deli sandwiches fried seafood bbq pork ribs fried chicken.  kind surprised see taping food demo deli station little more surprised Chef doing demo kind boss Executive Chef restaurant's sister restaurant .

This trip specifically came TastyKakes I guess east coast thing think Hostess but sweet. Also majority bill $13 2 family packs 5 indiviual packs 75 cents per pound broccoli crowns pretty much only vegetable 2 year old willingly eat ended getting really good deal shucked fresh corn $1 bag 5 ears huge watermelon $2.98 bottled water 2 gallons 99 cents case 12 sport top nestle pure lifes $1.18 .  Oh received 2 free items week Bottom Line Occasional good deals produce protein. Clean but worth driving 15 minutes freeway aside few far between TastyKake cravings when Fresh Easy Albertson's Smith's walking distance home. Just saw news Glazier's sold space closing permanently few weeks.  sad.   

I'll miss being able come nostalgic snacks East Coast Tastycakes Junior's cheesecake Wise potato chips.  also miss selections sodas...so many weird flavors bacon anyone? ...so little time try them all.  

And saddest part being able order XZY Anytown USA having shipped here.  couldn't always things requested.  But product manager would definitely try us. 

Well Glazier gang... thank indulging past year.  Best luck your next adventure. Great prices poultry meats. Until bought some steaks within two days brown. throw them away when used date wasn't even close. Another note if want great produce any sort place it! Never any good looking selection nor fruit sweet. deli good people nice but other then store only shop specific speciality items stuff back east some good Italian Spanish dishes u due high prices. Also truly feel bad cashiers clearly never fixed ac front hot there! always tell them bad feel them during check out. won't shopping glaziers much anymore. Graziers much better Vons across road. good fish bread products etc. Also good selection foods wine. most cases reasonable prices.. Awesome place found sell lychee pasteles also. reasons why shop there. Glazier's basically takes your traditional grocery store everything better.  Instead starbucks use illy deli counter enormous stocked full boar's head cold cuts meat seafood departments offer great looking food.

Everyone store helpful friendly produce section along entire store seems clean neat.  Misti stated review store several ready to eat counters easily grab quick meal eat take quick work lunch.  Overall very impressed Glazier's plan making place visit frequently. Wednesday's edition Las Vegas Review Journal always must see any Yelper because always listing naughty restaurant busted Southern Nevada Health District blowing bad.     Hey sometime worse because know kitchen areas super clean violations....well hopefully

Now brings front page food section why heck all LVRJ readers always asking where find fhis around Las Vegas Valley.    Good grief LVRJ readers just Glaziers because every week answers usually  same.. found Glaziers.    Sometimes wonder if readers LVRJ brain dead?  Well yeah....any reader submitted best Italian restaurant Las Vegas Olive Garden...Can't smart. 

The rule thumb Glaziers always pick circular before walking into store.   usually few specials front page you'll need those in store coupons.   Glaziers food marketplace largest supermarket Las Vegas wonderful deli area pretty good selection produce.   saying place if can't find market might find Las Vegas.  some degree  true statement.

Heads Ahi Poki very good supermarket But why Glaziers across town Henderson.   Please open your store Henderson soon. 3rd review Glazier's.  Gee whiz find time?  Actually time I'd focus prepared food items pizza salad bar gelato.

I tried pepperoni roll ups swedish meatballs some other easy prep items Mrs. G's prepared food area.  None which worth trying again.  sadden say really am.  None items any zip taste verve.  

The fiancee recently purchased 'new' pizzas.  NY style deep dish thin crispy crust.  somewhere between NY hmm.... no words describe it.  pizza chef manager told Glazier's recently within last 4 months changed pizza recipe.  wonder why?  selling many complaints many whiny commentors?  new version brought home okay definitely worth forgetting about.  sauce pizza really quite upsetting.  personally don't enjoy munching tomatoes pizza huge chunks them sauce!

Ahh good ole salad bar.   love thee.  fresh clean good.  fingers want keep piling vegetables to go container when around thee.  But $6.88 per lb. must  exercise restraint already created 2 lb. + monster your bed greens.  

Remembering when Glazier's first opened fresh dipped ice cream available scoop.  Ice cream good but mood it.  However recently there's change freezer GELATO!  stuff gelato yummy goodness always mood for!  COOKIES CREAM MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP weaknesses.  Glazier's carries both!  WHY damn it!  However $3.79 3 scoops cannot cower price I'd willing pay double perhaps triple and paid 5x amount same thing Forum Shops @ Caesar's .

Though Glazier's needs some work Mrs. G's prepared foods pizza they're doing mighty fine job salad bar!  whomever decided replace ice cream authentic Italian  gelato coming over give big kiss j k . bought Breyers ice cream gritty.  If gritty old. lot items way overpriced 2 3x more Smiths. Produce bruised substandard. However lot specialty items can't find elsewhere NYC bagels gnocchis etc. store clean but  likely people shopping there. coming back anytime soon. First time going Glaziers wowed layout store. almost Whole Foods far having deli different choices food order. But say thing pizza. *Hard*. Thinking being New York style pizza you'd think thin crust . really. dough pretty tough flaky crispy. If saved pizza leftovers when cools going play Frisbee golf. instructions pizza only states Preheat oven 350F .  it. doesn't tell long actually bake for. marinara sauce alright. would say only good thing pizza. cheese pizza because pepperoni pizza only maybe 10 12 pepperonis. just didn't look enough pepperoni. pepperoni individually. far take bake pizza wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather Costco. Someone else said Fresh Easy meets Whole Foods. think  pretty accurate. Glazier's great selection produce ethnic ingredients. also super bakery gelateria coffee counter deli meat seafood section. addition variety prepared meals if aren't cooking type just want warm something but don't want Lean Cuisine Hungryman again. people work always really friendly helpful. ladies deli counter particularly friendly station front deli where enter your order come back pick you're finished rest your shopping rather waiting.

Someone gave them star review because wouldn't allow use fiance's credit card. think just good business practice accept cards when person presenting them does name said card. Someone else said she allowed take pictures. taken pictures without incident seems suspect well.

Overall great place shop. hear they're opening Green Valley soon too. Wow.  all in one grocery store better chains usually happy soon living right next door place.  keep immaculate well stocked service great.  everything think cakes frozen fish fresh sausage fresh pizza.  could eat every day lunch really.  Great prices too. Easy parking. Clean Spacious. Fruits Vegetables price very low. awesome. International aisle expensive did needed. Other customer service cashiers great. back. love grocery store. ginormous fresh fruit great. and greatly priced! offer wide selection everything. only thing wish would more selection natural organic foods along some greek yogurt. Other place lets walk around hours finding new things home. and getting hungry along way. The staff friendly helpful help answer any question may have. know rarely give anything 5 stars.  Anyways let know tried many things including Ms. G's pesto pasta salad chicken caesar mexican lasagne various sundry other foodstuffs fish chix meat preparared foods salads ginger sesame chicken lobster .  last ones pre seasoned u just cook re heat ready 2go.  Yum O definitely no costly going 2eat. Glaziers customer service top notch.  called looking particular item SAME DAY 5pm 2 cases waiting cooler me.

Their house made paninis delicious pizza fresh sushi tasty cuts meat pricey but worth house made sausage flavorful.
Shop sales good deals!
Looking forward going more often.  Thank you! Pretty torn Glazier's. When walk ton freshly prepared food waiting you. Pick nice deli sammie huge pizza to go meal heat later cafe latte. 5 stars!... But then hit weak produce section tiny lil' 'healthy' section come back down reality... Glazier's just normal ish market. Given you'll find some gems along way I snagged random knish Chicago damn good but most part let down me. Take into account only judge crap typically buy could your favorite store. just A OK. Somewhere above Von's but way below WF TJ's. Absolutely love place! Only negative comment don't organic whole milk toddler. food unique delicious. everything could need more. PRICIng pretty good especially meat. love place almost much Trader Joes SPROUTS. Forget OVERPRICED WHOLE FOODS yuck . market interesting affordable groceries INCREDIBLE service. Paper bags would only thing would say needs change. Trader Joes only grocer uses paper bags LOVE THAT! HATE plastic bags. love Glazier's.  checkout fast courteous selection great.  place far superior Vons store across street.  great hot food selection well those frequent times am lazy cook.  may also cleanest grocery stores ever visited.

What keeps giving Glazier's five stars fact 24 hour store.  Also find coupons tend hit miss.  Seriously week free two liter bottle some sort crappy generic diet soda.  Yeah beating down door one.  If coupons useful items would give five stars. Wednesday January 3rd 2018 3 PM

This review last Glazier's since Smith's bought building..  shopping over 6 years now drive way shop there.  miss East Coast family market. best steak dinners under $10!  carried best Italian cheese raviolis Drake's Devil dogs.  served Spring Valley well over last 8 voted best Las Vegas years.   miss them dearly. posted pictures sure why weren't review? Glaziers  very nice supermarket family feel.  probably because family owned market. Vons across street declining quality increasing prices  rude  staff especially manager.
This glaciers high quality produce fresh great prices friendly staff overall great store.
I've just switched very disappointed cake ordered works year anniversary. asked cake looked business card said could picked looked nothing card. supposed black pink pink more red anything. Whatever food color black way MUCH. dyed teeth black fingers. serving customers unacceptable. If tell mimic picture actually say can't simple that. store trying hard outpost displaced persons northeast .  succeed some areas fail others.  First ready eat ready heat section many Italian specialties.  pizzeria giant pizzas 30' if recall just well done north easterner.  subs cold hot try those soon.  knocked Taylor Ham.  local smiths carries whole pound sleeve but joint ready sliced deli department just cheap back east but hey 2500 miles alot transport cost. say Glazier's? simply awesome store! live East side Las Vegas but when West side never miss chance Glazier's! Beautiful produce section really yummy bakery products. But spend hours deli section trying select sandwich meats single serving entrees side dishes. eat too. microwave heat your food pizza sushi sandwiches. if look hard throughout store you'll find small displays snacks gotta try. Glazier's definitely shopping adventure! dream strange things. Midgets ponytails armed man juggling Faberge eggs sober Lindsay Lohan PTA meeting stroking  head child isn't retarded born addicted cocaine.  Strange dreams. Sometimes situations affect your dreams. once asleep raft middle Indian ocean third day dreamed taking shower stardust soaping Judith Light now Judith Light but second season Boss Judith Light...I am sick. When living Pago Pago few months while run Romanian VCR smugglers dreamed being smothered giant coconut needle stuck it...long story.  Lastly when was...um...in college for 11 years good behavior deductions ...I dreamed supermarkets. Standing front commissary staring Pall Mall Marlboro 2 kinds spam your mind races your heart yearns  your bowels release thought fully stocked supermarket.

In Las Vegas only time your bowels release if dare eat manager's special meats Smith's...hell if even touch feel dribble...or leakage if prefer. Smith's don't dream unless hate humanity. Albertson's don't dream unless dream gouging humanity. Von's...maybe...if dream low.  No dream Glazier's Food Marketplace.  

The first thing Glazier's clean. exceptionally clean. would lick floor wouldn't most places but wouldn't send hospital. strange being Las Vegas seeing such clean store. Las Vegas. Las Vegas beautiful clean new sexy...or dirty disgusting usually high meth verge collapse...thankfully Glazier's former.  Glazier's sponsor Smith's dirty disgusting homeless drug addict. seen them NA. Glazier's all clean reciting steps he inspirational story tell. Smith's eating flies off shirt sweating profusely. 

Next thing notice Glazier's cheap. Von's where specials cheap rest very expensive. Glazier's special great normal prices excellent. price point Smith's without chance hepatitis food poisoning. 

Now look around see all different sections peruse... Seafood section deli butcher bakery pizza place fresh sushi on. sushi better Whole Foods Trader Joe's much better price. fish fresh tastes really great.  baked breads very good donuts amazing pastries great.  also import baked breads cheesecakes Carnegie Deli other great items quality vendors.  sausage factory...okay...read again...SAUSAGE FACTORY. am talking Cherry Saturday night...I am talking real sausage. 

The fruit vegetable selection excellent cheap fresh. bought vine ripened Beefsteak tomatoes .88 lb. Outstanding. Bought some great oranges mushrooms scallions.  

Lastly all done time...I mean spent time...in East cost know only good sweet treat...and virtually no Las Vegas.  Tastycakes. Yes dear reader...Tastycakes. best desert human being buy. Glazier's them because east coast history.

If good food. If different foods. If good deals. If clean. If self respect. If Pilipino biker chicks...sorry...wrong review...then Glazier's.  Just remember dear readers...never ever stand cart tell them only thing more beautiful Glazier's Food Marketplace pull down your pants.  No matter right are...they pretend don't it. Damn Puritans...you ruined country! LOVE Glaziers. great selection things won't find elsewhere. don't need? owner told special order anything like. find best Swedish pancake mix Lingonberry jam. Ok bakery salad bars good. cakes cookies just don't find other major chain grocery stores. All Mrs G's dishes delicious. haven't bad one. haven't ordered hot food section yet. always great service. Only once meat guys seemed really irritated but probably just bad day complicated request. ordered 2 specialty cakes them both really good creative totally reasonably priced. Yep going Glaziers long live Vegas. 

Update. ordered cakes them before always loved them. example awesome cakes. just told bakery wanted snake themed cake. got. perfect!! love super market!!! Mrs G good thing going on. Everything top notch fresh fresh fresh!! Prices very affordable. always some Serrano ham Porscuitto di Parma here. Love love love it!! Can't believe till now.  Visited other day.  

If East Coast looking some East Coast Favorites YOUR place.  all items able source around town but much cheaper anywhere else all place.

    selection FRESH items fish Meats could better but bad.

NY Bagels Pizzelle's Philly Tastycakes Perogies East Coast Italian Food raviolis pasta even homemade items Stuffed cabbage stuffed peppers etc.  All items kid.  

They great NY cookies reasonable price $8.88 per pound. Just extremely expensive...thats all. especially prepared foods...Employees very drab really friendly something must going management because folks always picketing outside Fckd takes away shopping experience.... fact Glaziers everything find Vons across street then some. great selection organic products produce meats lower prices would see Whole Foods Trader Joe's. 

I come Glaziers quite often when isn't anything fridge dinner. Glaziers always saves hunger pains. cute little dining area self playing grand piano use paid your meal. salad bar fantastic. little pricey almost $7 pound give great selection. taste freshness all products well. find your regular salad bar goodies your lettuce carrots broccoli etc. well pasta salads marinated mushrooms marinated artichokes good array other fancy salad dishes. sell yummy sandwiches pastas pizzas. day time there's sushi guy rolling California shrimp tempura rolls addition salmon tuna sushi pieces. personally sushi good quick fix. wide selection ready made individual dinners. lasagna pasta meat dishes perfect buy eat later. only thing think bit overpriced i.e. small individual piece lasagna $6 Glaziers sells great products throughout store but found some items expired. last trip made found 2 week old Greek yogurt still chilling shelf. cool. sure check dates before throwing something your cart! quick update add some extra stars. Glaziers really starting hit stride heap options available elsewhere.

They seem pretty good picking customer suggestions hoping some favourites added. Here's hoping! Just served stuffed shells super bowl delicious. Better any homemade shells  ever had! Glazier's brand frozen no sauce 8 per package. milk frozen section. think $4.68. won't disappointed. people friendly!

I've many times but couldn't check until recently.  thing spelling Glaziers incorrectly. GLAZIERS GLACIERS! isn't regular shopping place but because laws brothers live store come once while fix poke.  last few times came all bought out.  But when find fresh good.

The Apple Fritters STEAL delicious!  WEAKNESS!  

The produce great deli bakery butcher top notch.  bought bread produce meats POTATO SALAD.  all really good.  

They salad bar well prepared food.  trying group people come lunch try sometime.

I did price some items buy lot Kashi Cereal Quaker Rice Cakes. prices those items competitive.

Besides place extremely clean employees stellar most prices work. Its good cheap close house ! Glad shop over big boys !! love place drive 50 miles shop but Mens restroom filthy Christmas eve day plus  toilet seat broke which safety issue thank God caught time ! Used Paper all over floor! spoke person seemed authority anout she snapped saying well busy today! replyed no excuse Hygene safety store enough money ! used shop Glazier's lot.  However only now stuff can't anywhere else.  Watch expiration dates merchandise.  don't rotate stuff well just don't care.  actually seen lot dairy stuff expiration dates approaching day two already expired merchandise.  also seen cheese mold there.  staff friendly all either.  mention all signs rules them.  customer's always right?!  store.  prices staples non perishables much higher other stores.   I'd love support local businesses over national chains but they've give reason. Always pass place when running errands decided try out.

Parking quick easy good.  Walked little blown away very big open! little hard feel first time because no sense direction store sectioned.  

Their fruits vegetables looked very fresh prices great.  pretty much everything vons smiths does prices seem cheaper . front ready pay total came $100 bucks.  honestly feel could gotten better deals Vons Smiths.

I feel should maybe try place again before head back same old grocery stores. food boner 6 midnight walking here. 

I'll never shop another grocery store. Vons lost business second took look inside place shopped first time.

I highly recommend shopping if live area. Highly. Great place shop groceries come all groceries except fruit. fruit always terrible condition. Especially strawberries always looking old n up. stick Costco getting fruits. Other fruit great. always promoted store others loved discounted wines extensive Deli Goya choices all real New York imported specialty items. Non other comes close.

Unfortunately discovered use nasty scam tactic store offering free Norbet Turkey Thanksgiving day shoppers if spend $150 other groceries.  No where coupon does say cannot include Dairy Alcohol purchase time you're checking out.  cashier eager educate tell law include those items.  never heard law but would nice reminded ad before check out.  cashier seemed very annoyed idea wanted free turkey Glazier's used lure store begin with.  cashier rude it.  hit $130 grabbed other items around meet goal 150 eggs wine pulled off equation.  Glazier's please post law your ads train your nasty cashiers obviously annoyed blowing 150 your store free turkey.  takes any joy shopping your great store away end. very confused why people think best grocery store Vegas.  am consistently annoyed when coming because while carry kitschy items most other stores don't carry don't carry many normal things variety tomato sauces pickles olives.  also don't very good organic produce section.   would much rather pay more across street Von's frustrated going into store. favorite place veggies fruits. fresh cheap! Good selection buy especially if you're into juicing. sad place closing. great selection wines produce. Also lots items only east coast Amazon. staff nice friendly. guys missed many. new local Vegas just getting used all stores.  happy find Glaziers.  prices extremely reasonable weekly deals great.  Always pick coupon paper your way in.  usually two free items when purchase more 25 dollars groceries.  Anything toothpaste celery.  also great package deals where if buy some meat bunch free stuff.  high quality stuff sprite potatoes onions buns etc...but free great when budget.  nothing but great interactions staff.  deli counter ladies actually cutting coupons sure discounts.  

I saw someone posted produce just day away being rotten.  found case.  If know inspect fruits veggies ie don't buy greens yellow isn't problem.  Everyone should know shop veggies if don't probably shouldn't vegetarian.

I'm going back right moment...glad place close me! wife frequent store regularly usually nothing but great things say. However before interaction management staff morning.

I mission find some thin mints Grandma's X Mas eve dinner. Knowing east coast family run store figured would them being Grandmother New York traditionally thin mints table dating back New York. Therefore playing hockey going gym stopped see if any Thin mints... know kind made Zachary white box. 

After asking some various store clerks checking candy isle discovered in stock left. car drove towards TJMaxx when saw four people upper manager supervisor security guard maintenance guy staring angrily vehicle drove by. Thinking thought may stole something stopped asked if issue. responded negatively maintenance guy shooed along condescendingly. felt very uncomfortable degraded say least. 

Because shop often wanted back clear any possible misconceptions. met same hostility told thought someone supposedly other stolen something. manager still unapologetic hostile approach left still feeling suspected wrong doing. felt way because maintenance guy weirdly laughing managers where surrounding nonchalantly attempting look away but obviously because me. felt verge getting maintenance guys broomstick.

I understand shrinkage retail big problem during holidays but approach wrong thuggish. only hope someone else leaves without purchasing does same accusatory demeanor received today  not everyone suspect.

I hope Glazier's management team thinks perception next time group employees come running store angrily looking customer leaving only because he she did find item looking for. love store. don't know why but do.

I'll start reasons shouldn't love it...okay yes produce hot not.. Sometimes BEST looking everything sometimes things last leg.

Sometimes prices everyone town. Sometimes things priced high.

Sometimes employees grumble seem annoyed but mostly NOT. seems owner runs tight ship some stress understandable... attention detail usually obvious.

I love owned operated family. most shopping regardless any negative aspects. try bring things people request. carry Chicago products no else carries. opinion really good pizza whether take bake already made.

I guess vibe when first shopped didn't seemed weird food court store. Now just it. different small business way chain supermarkets not. think would fall Locavore category. even carry locally produced stuff Pahrump Valley Coffee CJ's Custard 2 favorites.

I love bring grandmother she argue owner pineapples. Please bring back CHINA MIST tea! fave! admit rating night somewhat colored fact location far destination really worth trip. kind kind wasn't.

I really happy meat selection variety baked goods including cannoli shells sold separately filling must overall treasure hunt feel because never know you're going find. A recent addition household inexplicable fondness Shasta Tiki Punch sell 12 pack $2.50. Score! They lot items sale oranges 50 cents pound small artichokes 4 dollar boneless chicken breast $1.44 pound Pretty good. But if come seeking treats East Drake's Cakes Wise chips seemed hideously overpriced especially since recently flood Wise chips sale beloved 99 cent store .

And pretty good stock wine but check Lee's Walmart first sure you're really getting bargain.
Finally stopped counter lunch way pretty disappointed. employees nice enough but reuben scrawny panini shrimp sandwich special watery bland flavorless. 

I probably back because Babygirl loved hot links found Logilicious consumes Tiki Punch apocalypse near really want try those cannolis.
However wait until headed side town anyway. great variety good price awesome installation. appreciate all vibe cleanliness. 
I've shopping often sea food meat always good quality freshness.
I really love marketplace!
If follow Instagram see least weekly pick some King's Hawaiian Rolls son's preschool class because neighborhood. Holy Shnikies! Its Disneyland grocery stores. first thing see HUGE food court take cakes deli GELATO BAR! Its gorgeous Dulce De Leche staring face. Luckily hurry didn't succumb temptation. Everyone friendly smile face. gentleman I forgot name because busy telling monkeys NO  Stop offered help out. 

What awesome store. Unfortunately isn't close but definitely stop again when neck woods. Beware!! other day mother looking frozen tortellini 2 bags $4 name italian feast believe. Anyways pick bag tri colored tortellini looked date only find expired 9 13. 2013!!!!  YEAR OLD!!!!! took bag cashier told her. Hopefully all removed before somebody gets sick. sure always check dates!!! Another thing bought pears night brought them home already completely ROTTEN! holes looked mold well. only few hours... good produce. Plus always compare prices. There's stuff $5 Smiths $1.99. Customer service great! also love store always clean! Im fan produce... but LOVE Boar's Head Deli meat lot east coast products other stores Las Vegas don't carry Home BAIT Switch. advertise weekly flyer hamburger 99 cents pound. spent time money store say misprint correct price $3.96. plenty time send followup flyer but did not. When home called them manager stubborn.No negotiation no compromise nothing. She claimed fine print very fine high power magnifying glass use read different page claim responsible typographical errors. ever heard proofreading?  care customer spends time money store?   past chicken leg special 38 cents pound. did put sufficient quantities thus could any asked rain check. Those gave rain check said would call when came but no guarantee price.I never call expires 30 days anyway.Funny other stores honor prices rain checks.  Thus weekly flyer only useful l litter box liner.  Shop elsewhere advise all others same. Avoid them.They could honored price lost little over week.By limiting quantities no would objected that loss would small but customer retention would high.  If manager better attitude would helped well.  greed action bait switch tactic all frequent. just want say Thank  'TONY'  working deli. Turkey cheese where sliced perfection.  Very  knowledgeable Boar head products.. ..  great customer  service people  skills!! think funny people wrote star reviews continue shop CHECK IN! lmao

I think very unique place. Never boring selection. Cashiers staff always friendly. Mr. Glazier always around greets customers. cannot compare Grocery Stores Winco. prices bc can't compete. But never disappointing shop best Suncoast Potato Salad world!!! yummy! Great grocery store terrible deli service. 1 2 people line deli meat took 4 women  20 minutes slice 1 4 lb each. extremely slow rude. growing me. Let's start Sunflower now Sprouts HUGE disappointment competition them tides changed. Yes Glaziers more expensive quite few items but Sprouts going way too. did find vegetarian section. Again expensive but usually stuff Target. hands down absolute BEST cole slaw YEARS. every single time go. fantastic. Sure dont dairy products name brand stuff Id but close home self checkout liquor prices pretty darn close Lee's discount liquor. save myself trip liquor store FAR trip Sprouts. growing quite bit. I'd say SOLID 3.5 but feeling fancy give extra star tonight! love shopping here. atmosphere calm no matter time day week come here.
It bit pricier other grocery chains but family owned. Some weekends afford come others much. Depends what's list.

Meats They really best seafood town. husband eat seafood most week. When sale which least once month stock up!

Bakery Best doughnuts much bakery. think some cakes okay but hit miss. cookies same hit miss.

Grocery I fact bring local favorites across country. buyer store knows Vegas becoming transplant city. just wish they'd anti tex mex. also vegan international selection. more natural international vegan product selection competition.

Dairy eggs etc The coffee creamers bit over priced. usually avoid buying creamers buy Walmart instead 3 4$ cheaper! . Never issue milk cream selection. Usually hate part grocery shopping experience because spilled milk left grates spoils smell nauseated. Glazier's does EXCELLENT job keeping those grates clean! Eggs... check your eggs before put them your cart as any grocery store . just remember going through 8 cartons eggs until found didn't broken egg.

Checkout Customer service I see Mr. Glazier himself walking floor every now then. Portly old white dude black suit. never spoken but he seems good rapport staff gotta give props being floor instead holing himself office.
Self check easy... unless you're waiting newbie then painful. lol 
The cashier's always friendly. There's always front end manager nearby. bought salt salt water tank bag leaking. last bag front end manager duct tape tape us. Like said love coming here. wish price matched. take coupons.... still expensive. Some weekends list longer set budget end having pass awesome place by. Great place shop sugar free salad dressings choc syrp. Hard find items R here. Love absolutely love store! 

The staff nice help find whatever need.  store least once week.  only found carries The Greek Gods greek yogurt honey flavored love much.  usually don't yogurt...but some awesome stuff.  produce very fresh wide array pastries desert.  always some sort sale free items once spend over $25.   

This store very clean too. bad bad. Made way check market let say pretty impressive! 

Freshness all around! spent hour market 40 minutes probably pastry section trying mind get! Loved Boars Head Deli goodies catered all fresh ham cheese platter even chicken wing platter! Yum. 

Produce fresh market clean customer service stellar found lady fingers! looking everywhere. D love place! huge super market complete deli bakery eatery everything else.  No really everything else.  great hidden gem east coast goodies well!

I 110% approve pizza.  change things huge 28 pie just $20 bucks! good stuff great stuff. Seriously. don't store area town.  son use all time.  decided check since area.  over salad bar.  some marinated asparagus minced onions crab salad pasta salads marinated artichoke hearts.  some other stuff.  put little container.  just wanted try little little that.  really liked crab salad marinated asparagus.  walked around store saw quite few unique items. didn't even walk entire store.  looking forward checking entire store when time. BEST GROCERY STORE TOWN! absolutely love glazier's pastas chips even pico de gallo! store super clean easy find items need! ice cream selection divine always buy something never intended buy holiday season exploring options prepared Thanksgiving meal found myself Glazier's see offer browsed more shopped.  didn't realize large store is.  entering headed deli.  prices seem reasonable sushi sandwiches prepared items.  visit grabbed few donuts.  don't some clearly labeled some not.  don't want buy appears chocolate bar bite down into filling.  meat department salmon happened sale day did purchase that.  Being fan Jelly Belly's appreciate any store purchase pound mix whatever flavors want.  also noticed nostalgia candy.  can't remember last time saw candy cigarettes. 

As far Thanksgiving meal did choose buy there.  didn't seem worth once realized small sides offered side options weren't appealing.  Sprouts win one!  Now if hadn't sold fried turkey might persuaded. Glazier's Costco Mariana's Lee's Whole Foods International Marketplace all rolled into one!

Great Selections reasonable prices they've even aisle  Hawaiian goodies home...Hopefully more locations open around town take over all other popular markets...ALOHA!!! used love shopping because variety products such pleasant employees I should say most time but ever cashier lose mind over handing pizza? Let tell slightly less pleasant. mean incredibly awkward confusing.

If you've shopped know Biaggio's pizza inside also just purchase pizza ready put oven take home. 

When checking last grocery trip handed cashier big pizzas didn't fit belt somehow infuriated no end. She started audible ugh eye rolling then started telling more attitude heard grown adult life didn't scanner pizza would just wait. 'ok cool' because no biggie all. Then she reiterated but even more pissed off time would just wait point clear she starting lose literally done nothing but stand rushing saying anything all even hurry whatsoever. If you've seen wide eyed emoji pretty much face through whole interaction. 
Somehow she scanned pizza honestly didn't know she talking regards scanning pizza begin moved until she ring some wine. 
Apparently trigger too. She asks ID starts pretty quickly demanding rudely while try pull wallet would describe regular faster average pace then just asked deal why she being rude because clearly something going it.

This when she started raising voice even more saying over over she wasn't being rude in extremely rude way lol accusing 'going on' pizza reminded fact that all did hand pizza because all did hand pizza. bad guess.

I wish would just left groceries gone Smith's Albertson's because dealing unexplainable angry girl worth it. all bad days understand but you've gotta able keep crazy under wraps when you're dealing innocent bystanders.

And think needless say never shop again.

Smith's might deli meat dept Glazier's does but least don't worry dealing kind random misdirected anger end your workday. favorite super market. lose star because produce needs upgrade though. Good prices huge selection. Quality good Vons Smiths. No gas station though. weekends union goons front picketing. Store clean meat looks fresh guys deli quick fill your order. Parking plentiful lot well lit night. Now favorite grocery store.  People used work always raved place.  just never took time drive there.  Walked shopping TJ Maxx.  Sure glad did.  LOVE selection ready eat entrees specialty grocery items.  Staff also friendly.  Nelson Pizza area doll.  Wanted some wings gonna take some time cook.  Told would back later.  Returned just finished cleaning getting ready close area.  sweet.  He set some aside me.  Thank Nelson!!! Love grocery store. best salads salad bar...People ask them everyday work.. Great value! Visit least 3 times week. weird go to places eat inside grocery store? roll sushi some seaweed salad latte tea long way books especially when enjoy little dining area playing grand piano. favorite places people watch thumb through Las Vegas Weekly just chill 'til next episode AKA until lunch break over. also pretty great salad bar pizza deli if don't sushi. 

I've only shopped couple times mostly specialty items Chicago. did pick half pound cookies NY self service $4 ate secret. 

I ain't even mad aboot it. 

PS. Lady coffee bar area nice. Always smile face small talk. Love her! love place!

I would given 5 stars but very disappointed produce apples always bruised bad bananas green wait 5 6 days before eating them choose produce here. 

Ok good part absolutely love homemade section left all homemade pies cakes cookies pastries donuts name it. also love sides also sauces scratch such Alfredo marinara pesto even fresh pasta too! amazing meat selection find all kinds meat any cut too.Their delis awesome place your order several different ways even your phone! thing im hooked right now old fashion sodas love cream soda best cream soda ever! just all around love store simple fact many unique foods items cant regular stores. Yes prices little higher but find its worth shopping peaceful theres alot less ghetto people shopping then walmart shopping enjoyable. love shopping Glaziers.  Sections laid nicely.  gourmet choices good prices.  People cool.  lobster steamed while shopping grab way out... When home ready start cracking.  also love olive bar deli ready bake pizza gelato bar weekly specials steak night etc. best grocery store ever in. relaxed old fashioned atmosphere creates sense personal experience each shopper. Product cleanliness service all above A+. Love place!!! ...Everything imported NY area even homemade pastas amazing! Looking food specialty found East Coast instance Drake's cakes other delicious items especially gelato. ran across place way appointment.  usually southwest.  kind wish closer.  Reasonably big store lot things don't see elsewhere particularly produce section where cross between regular mexican asian markets.  number in house restaurants lot prepared foods go.  more browse check things buy good thing wasn't particularly hungry would trouble!  No smoothie juice bar which #1 list type store but certainly lot variety everywhere. Love grocery store. deli produce butcher more impressive selection prices just right. many meals grab well salad bar. fresh Cannoli's fantastic too! All around just good local market. don't understand why grocer open.  If you'd deals Albertsons.  If you'd small shopping store experience Trader Joes.  Organic Whole Foods.  majority time store overpriced seems confused kind grocer is. Lol great Glaziers raise all prices full retail then take 25 percent off entire store GOING BUSINESS SALE. Listen Mr. Glazier you've nobody hoodwinked time. Here's why... because business done fini...Game over.

Ladies Gentlemen great pay last mortgage payment MacDonald Ranch going business sale LOL!

Go back East coast where belong...SUCH GREEDY OPERATION.

Extra Extra...Get your old rotten food double prices now!! Bye Bye! all in one grocery store. only groceries but huge salad bar pizza chicken paninis sushi more 'food court' area. huge fresh made convenience pre made packaged food area. Nice size deli slicing mostly Boar's Head meats cheeses. great bakery all kinds fresh breads rolls pastries enough diabetic into sugar coma just walking it.

Forgive done homework folks own place but there's definite Northeast connection somewhere here. lot products heard only found 'back east'. Well back east stay right Vegas you've craving.

Produce main reason come here. always best looking stuff but can't prices. If stand carrots crooked dogs hind leg cilantro looks bit gangly then try out. Don't wrong lot top quality stuff love hot pepper selection and price .

Fresh frozen fish meat area decent good selection sometimes good deals other times not. 

Otherwise migrate left right as most people do you'll find occasional good deal but honestly Smiths Vons canned goods dairy breakfast foods etc. price wise Glaziers can't quite compete there. most smart shoppers compare prices your own choices.

Overall good fun place shop and browse employees always very friendly although music play overhead probably among worst ever. But hey don't let keep checking Glaziers hands down best grocery store Vegas. better second best grocery store Vegas that'd Whole Foods district Henderson having both great selection non organic non all natural items having spectacular deals. regularly two giant freshly cut chicken breasts meat department less $2.50. place featured extreme couponing recently BOGO excellent already nicely priced cheeses caused buy max consecutive days. Sh*ts cheap yo.

Also produce all appears sculpted wax. amazing. Most fruits vegetables cut open displays see grade you're buying. fruits never seen before star fruits seem tame. Beyond meat department custom order things happily if don't already it. provided some finest turkey legs lamb ever graced grill. stopped first time today. sign corner Warm Springs Durango caught eye few times before checking them Yelp decided stop see about.

The front store boasts several large signs voted best grocery store Vegas. most part just regular store. large section hot foods even coffee ice cream counter service .

Their sale specials sets them apart other stores Smiths. don't need member special card receive deals. produce meat section all looked pretty fresh. Most national brand items same price would find other large chain stores.

I liked prices produce meats enough come back again when area. saddens note bad review towards favorite grocery stores. afternoon self checkout result window #3 able print receipt patron ahead me. checking asked Spanish lady why still haven't added chip system card checkout. works reply. perceived tone scolding asking. Overall employees very nice helpful. would lady representing company without additional customer service training.

Everyone friendly helpful most part. best place shop considering its massive speciality grocery store. store sorely missed. things no other store town had. Great meat fish counter. Everything ever would want store. surprised only store Vegas. does grocery star 1 star ask? Well grocery store gets 1 star when person self checkout rudest employee encountered grocery store.

It just irritating experience deters shopping again. Great grocery store great selection products. Only store carries Special K honey nut cereal bars. sure why cereal bars disappeared various other stores but has. Both butcher shop deli abundance choices choose from.

While going head over produces section butcher's arena.  
One today special 2 head cauliflower $3.  There's always some blowout deal going daily check frequently must fruits vegs.  Just sure give really good honest inspection before placing your cart.

I've also picked Cajun chicken breast $1.99 breast which conclude healthy valued meal under $5 veggies spare NY Steak selected 11.99 lb.   Everything reasonable price clearly safe say meat processing area suitable any handling raw meat fishes.  all performed open!

If don't 30min spare cook everything yourself also abundant prepped food sides to go containers made daily.   never tried but look very tempting. Everytime!  

This go to neighborhood store  even hood.  ride around  it.

Note Free A C! When first moved side town good friend all Oh you'll close Glazier's! naturally headed some heavy duty grocery shopping.  Bad idea.  Compared Smith's prices significantly higher.  would recommend doing regular grocery shopping here.

What would recommend checking Glazier's usually very cheap produce awesome deli.  place more expensive lot stores but higher class grocery shopping.  offer lot unique hard find items mentioned deli amazing.  prepared salads i.e. artichoke mozzarella salad very fresh tasty.  Also purchased Tuna Poke many times find best town! Horrible customer service cashier very rude helpful when doing 200 dollar grocery shop child. going since open but place getting horrible. Today having grocery shopping feel exhausted while cashier helpful made child good mood upside down. used love shopping Glazier's. USED love it. Today usual Monday morning grocery run. Since new iPhone wanted take photo post Yelp review. over bakery section employee comes just starts yelling can't take pictures here! AGAINST COMPANY POLICY! on. mean kind store doesn't allow photography any kind? wonder hell trying hide! 

So incident asked where stated policy said no photos. No signs posted anywhere. But when started looking around store noticed more more customer un friendly signs. All backpacks bags must checked.  refuse service anyone.  All bakery boxes opened checked. top off store hulky looking security guards wander store follow around! Glazier's feel thief! concluded should only shop if want made feel second class citizen shoplifter. Seriously!

I'm really sad because such nice store. Great produce while expensive everyday grocery shopping wide aisles wide assortment fun look around. 

Of course dissatisfied customer worse having 100 happy customers because believe am going share story everyone know. don't think Glazier's wants upset upper middle class community might want rethink unfriendliness store. Instead shopping Glazier's going Whole Foods only me. far best local market Las Vegas!!! enjoy time close woman nothing else better meanders through aisles target except play beautiful jazz classical music more flattering lighting. location spacious well planned layout. Prepared foods including gelato bar sushi station deli left favorite booze depo nestled right behind produce on.... Everyone friendly helpful. Prices fresh vegetables meat best town. 

I'm happy stumbled reminds AJ's Phoenix. Gloriously awesome butcher cheese section.  haven't able visit rest store buy seen far.  Can't wait back!!

Note some most fresh fish available town!! favorite market. Definitely mom pop place. place good people want cook themselves. great foods easily prepared. deli section if favorite part. Prices very good when sale. meat department also great price compared other grocery stores. Great selections deserts well. when you're looking something quick section where already prepared meal all home heat up. 

They also great selection Asian aisle

Very clean nice staff.... LOVE IT! 7 20 told couldn't tri tip because butcher left 4 30. Mind don't close till 8 pm. only slabs meat looked terrible. Off Costco go. won't stopping again. Finally found Empire chicken fat in frozen foods section . tag display saying Customer request  I don't know whether means they've just started carrying if don't all time.

Prices 10 15% higher other grocery stores but great place brands other stores don't carry.

Just wish closer  it's complete opposite end town me. I know they're conserving electricity but some sections store really dark. Replacing some spot lighting floods would better. friends recommends store over over finally in. clean amazing fresh produce selection. new favorite store love grocery store!  am incredibly sad know live other side town it.  hope build again because regular chain stores Vegas just don't cut it.

First off everyone friendly here.  feel welcome appreciated.  such rare thing any more when sunshine your face.

Secondly deli section!  ready eat meals waiting looking delicious awesome selection high quality meat cheeses then all fun stuff catch your attention didn't need but buy anyway because looks darn good.

Third prices really good selection everything pretty big. neighborhood shop but size Walmart.  great place shop at.

Go check look weekly meal deals some great deals dinner packages! would give 5 stars Them any hesitations!! best variety food all other items. panini share really awesome salad bar pretty good too. love shopping over Albertsons Smiths!! Absolutely terrible business practices!!!

I checking email work saw new weekly specials Glaziers awesome! Scrolled through saw deal Norbest turkey going $0.57 lb if spent $25 valid through 12 02. off lovely Vegas rain stock ham turkey Christmas.

Turns when deal expired 11 27 although said BLACK WHITE TODAY'S email good through 12 2. cashier checks manager then claims call OWNER says he honoring it. Seriously?! your WEBSITE printed circular hand your email. Buddy hate tell but you're doing fantastic job practicing false advertising. husband loyal supporters your store since opened but your questionable business practices apparent disregard your customer's time believe ability read means won't back. Vons less 60 seconds least honor word!

PS. Your Thousands Prices reduced tagline week's ad? Maybe should reduce price you're advertising. favorite grocery.  live St. Rose 15 usually during week 11AM Tuesdays Wednesdays.  always see Mr. G he says hello if he sitting upstairs office he wave hi.  say.  Bakery very good.  favorite items Italian bread NY style coffee cake.  just try cake once.  Donuts also very good morning great evening when now still full price versus half off several months ago.  Next deli.  OMG selection amazing.  deli meats cheeses other salads no other store compares prices selection.  Next seafood.  When live Maine lobsters which steam free am heaven.  Wide variety fish shellfish very affordable prices.  Next meats.  Quality far above Smith's Albert sons find prices much less.  particularly enjoy buying chicken cutlets which pounded sliced very thin excellent NY steaks boneless chicken breasts found beef all excellent quality.  Produce always priced competitively especially onions garlic tomatoes potatoes broccoli.  cheeses case  meat seafood counters outstanding.  Great prices all.  Italian pastas canned tomato products very good.  Most usual grocery items prices seem better Albertsons but maybe more expensive Smiths.  But remember store grocery products yearn which find your chain grocer Dr. Browns soda Drakes bakery products Vienna Beef products NY Chicago Italian products Cincinnati chili products list on.  recommend going hungry because whenever husband hungry tend spend well over $200.00.  only negative say cashier's very very slow.  occassion when noticed overcharged item took almost 10 minutes before pricing error verified corrected.

Update regular customer does live close just phoned store see if item stock girl answered phone Melissa stupid wanted pull hair out.  phone 3 times comprehend question. say never enjoyed going grocery store until found place! absolute favorite place groceries. Everything neatly organized fairly priced always tons weekly specials! calm clean clerks very nice helpful if ever need assistance. shop peace! Finally! Glazier's might new favorite places shop. seafood quality quantity pretty fresh. stopped live lobster. 11.99 lb steam you. also bought some live clams only 5.99 lb. think Glazier's reasonable price wise especially fresh seafood but other things pretty pricey. clean efficient most everything might need. know back Glaziers more delicious meals. usually head left side store right away following goods. Largest selection Boars Head no fillers high quality meat cheese other deli products. Every week special part meat part cheese full pound which great deal. The bread department some goodies pretzel sub rolls yummy Hubby loves italian cookies sold pound New York bagels signs says made New York water haha case. I also imported Parmesan in generic clear containers . Sometimes loaf bread $2.22 sourdough favorite showing SF pride . son some odd reason wants check fish department just look. curious try some items special but yet ventured there. gotten some wines too. Reasonable prices. section store where usually pick items. 

In between greeting cards wine Hawaiian Foods aisle which where chip mixes sour cream less $3 packet we first saw them Cost Plus but then discontinued . think Kosher department located too. 

There huge selection chips I opt unsalted kettle kind . October tried Winder Farms seasonal pumpkin egg nog it delish . freezer section because many options ice cream Ben Jerry's Thrifty Breyers etc. carry local brand gelatto CJ's . noticed biggest variety Pepperidge Farms freezer cakes a childhood favorite . Also favorite NY natives Tasty Cakes boxes sweet goods. also noticed huge Jelly Belly aisle. 

Like all grocery stores know good 'cause some prices little higher certain items. Being bargain shopper pretty much know usual price points. 

Checkout pretty quick. store clean. many boxes unless pretty late towards end night. always rec'd ads mail meaning pay visit finally area stopped in.

I felt Glaziers combination whole foods for organic options lower cost smith's they've deli cooked cooked mini costco because samples all wrapped one. prices just tad cheaper some things same little more expensive other things comparing. 

My husband kid candy store finding all things usually buy other places nice price Glazier's some great selections international food section. feel most comprehensive when comes Latin foods even Asian food supplies compared Smith's Von's Albertsons. 

The poultry area some stuff can't find elsewhere cubed pancetta. store Italian sausages both spicy regular. 

Certain deals happen time time least carry De Cecco brand pasta while other stores don't it. 

Prices competitive. produce section good but lack some herbs ingredients looking for. 

All all place legit. Just bought groceries place awesome! million things other grocery stores carry. coming back often weekly groceries! Prices aren't bad. Similar smiths vons. High quality items.

And carry canolis! reading reviews countless recommendations friend's wife thriftiest person know decided venture weekly ritual grocery shopping. Now normally hit two three stores week Sunflower Fresh Easy Smith's wasn't  expecting everything need store. also case Glazier's carried everything looking except organic fruit leather Boca Bits...I without fruit leather but Boca Bits staple household. maybe next time find items tend overwhelmed new grocery stores. opted Morningstar Farms starters...but anyway...I convenience Glazier's PetCo right next store. Typically house human food runs same time pet food happy. Second walk right into produce section. some stores isn't amazing but Glazier's wowed. produce section big everything looked good. purchased half dozen Gala apples looked better any seen any store. prices also very reasonable section. Third staff very friendly. Just everyone saw said hi asked if needed help. Finally multitude ready eat counters Misti talks about. didn't cruise section since trying quick. 
Overall weeks worth groceries spent $30 less Sunflower F E Smith's routine. only thing noticed more expensive Healthy Choice Asian Potsticker frozen dinner. Weird know...but its favorite frozen dinner ever. 
I definitely going back. may every week shop but  definitely hit again. if paying more spoiled meat chicken your place. store clean looks nice but many problems.

1 employees miserable shows least helpful group ever seen anywhere meeting mr glazier see why. very rude belligerent man.
2 everywhere cheap made athome signstelling toeat donuts till pay forthem 1 sample perperson andetc.. feel likea 2 yr old again.
3 prices canned goods frozendgoods healthcare ridiculously high
4 i bought some pork once homeand turned over gray andslimy smelly itook back toexchange butcher argued sayingthats its supposed be..lol... Interesting grocery store. Lots variety just moved saw casino grocery store crazy! did notice great variety meats sandwiches which perfect work day lunches. gelato store inside well prices seemed reasonable. love there's much chose from. also eat shop. Lots food already made buy. Good selection meats seafood. Prices super good! Produce best prices! Staff isn't much help kinda rude. new regular grocery store. Impressed customer service. find everything want here. customer Glazier's number years APPALLED today treatment received customer service desk subsequently Flora front end manager.

Every week shopping stop customer service roll quarters. Today told lady behind counter dont' normally but today. First all individual earns living developing customer service training programs taken back say least. asked speak manager presented lady named Flora only made matters worse. told customer years being told normally don't this. outraged me. She only made excuses NEVER ONCE apologized offer roll quarters right away. Glazier's owners should incensed lack customer service being exhibited front end management.

I informed Flora would shopping Glazier's any longer didn't phase least. even gave groceries just purchased asked refund.

I REFUSE shop establishment treats customers manner.

They tout themselves family owned ... mom pop which why support them. HATE BIG BOX RETAILERS but am now forced shop elsewhere due piss poor management entrusted store.

If don't mind being just another customer enjoy your shopping experience Glazier's. If value being treated valued customer RUN next closest store! Good selection veggies TERRIBLY RUDE STAFF!!! 

Went check ran into Cashier Tracy VERY VERY RUDE!!! guests before Caucasian watched greet them warm smile she very friendly them end order half watermelon she cashed them assuming watermelon mine. guests before tell watermelon she replied Oh didn't know yours. COURSE seeing divider between 2 transactions... 
When transaction over turn no greeting no smile no simple acknowledgement being just started ring items. being said HELLO TODAY ! reply oh forgot say hello busy today. those pretty much only words thank nice day nothing. informed supervisors Shawn because 100% knew other supervisor wouldn't say anything because she timid VERY NICE but Timid didn't seem type hold people accountable. Maybe something said done because expressed feelings discrimination supervisor discrimination isn't reputation want carry around company.
I am African American male she  Caucasian  Female blond hair. If need take complaint higher more willing! Market awesome! much. Great wine selection amazing deli bakery meat counter. only thing owners bit hard deal with. always store micromanaging staff. very picky frugal customers. But staff excellent. regular worker very easy deal with. Overall though awesome market! absolutely love everything market.  location perfect nearby Mountain's Edge Rhodes Ranch 215.  does crowded parking lot during rush hours but totally worth going market!  love selection meats seafood.  always ground beef chicken short ribs bacon shrimp if don't want far drive all way Seafood City.  believe selection Glaziers more variety other grocery stores. 

I also adore place because layout market. walk immediately step into vegetables area choice towards vegetables ready made food towards seafood chips cards aisles.  think everything spread perfectly here.  doesn't feel clustered aisles!  oriental section good selection which must me! 

They plenty organic foods.  Yay!  Lately market always organic brown large eggs where always eggs.  love organic bread Glaziers Whole foods only places organic bread!!  If thing need improve adding more organic vegetables market must!!  would definitely want come more vegetables!  Customer service always bright!m Ok place great. great selection great prices great prepared food section! little dimly lit but don't let discourage just plow thru find all hidden gems can't find anywhere else. While treat yourself donuts painfully good. Live Las Vegas cryin' loud! Glazier's boasts best grocery store Las Vegas. couldn't find reason disagree statement. Shopping very interesting compared regular grocery store. wish when co worker told Glazier's two years ago stopped immediately. much goodness missing.

The store reminds slightly conventional version Whole Foods. many extras over regular grocery store. coffee tea bar gelato cakes Italian cookies NY donuts prepared foods salad bar much more. prepared foods items I'd really want buy too. sides green bean casserole! area tables those want enjoy breakfast lunch store. 

Store offerings aren't limited cool stuff usual grocery items too. full produce section dairy case aisles shelf items. fish meat department largest ever seen store. store seemed grocery store plus me. carry everything regular grocery store carries plus more items. Every aisle brands recognize but flavors options didn't even know existed. even import homemade pasta New York wide selection it.

Aisles cases clean well organized. Items all well priced fully stocked. aisles wide. Everything store selection presentation store inviting. 

My absolute favorite part store import homemade pasta cookies New York. looked true Italian bakery cookies since moving finally found them! third visit gotta say really cut back since opened while ago. when first opened everything first class!... now its no class FAIL!!! employees meat seafood counter engaginging rough around edges maybe its just but dont being called bud  pal people supposed taking care me. selection gone way down since opening worst produce! believe could find decent nectarine peach plum during peak stone fruit season. sad but guess cut back everybody else. Last year might given Glaziers 5 stars but losing touch past year.
When first opened produce section thing beauty. hadn't seen such amazing fruits veggies since moved Las Vegas always bright shiny never squishy gross. Sadly isn't always case anymore. recently wrapped hand around leaking squishy rotted lemon. never oooh look delicious fruit dance produce section anymore.
The bakeries prices also sky rocketed.  usef cannolis fairly often but way expensive now. also don't care much cakes love cake. But no longer buy them Glaziers aren't very good expensive delicious. 
The meat seafood only reasons still shop here. chicken breasts super cheap mutant sized slice them half 4 normal sized breasts price two!!
They also carry tasty cakes boyfriend Pennsylvania happy. completely adore store. going almost since week opened. much seen complain even if want complain. walk someone always says hi every section someone help. seems everyone works knows entire store. could ask friendlier staff.

They little everything. produce good would fresh farmers market only cheaper. almost all produce there. love fact some fresh fruit tells where from. Thier watermelon some thier apples week come farm sandy valley farmers name it.

They real butcher!  night shopping steaks sale butcher said oh wait let cut some before leave asked thick wanted them.Hamburger chicken almost always sale. Normally 80% lean under two dollars. Seafood section if great well. Only complaint would don't always know cook some fish but only happen once. Never trying cook flounder again. haven't tried thier deli meat yet. 

Premade salads very yummy well. favorite macaroni. Made fresh daily think. try any thier salads if ask . always attempt try new when ever in. Only havent liked gotten yet pesto salad. am big pesto person but pesto wasn't bad. olive bar fresh salad bar standing. salad pizza lunch all time. If pizza crispy throw oven minute crisp up.For most part thier prices great. Some things bit much but over all  say best grocery store to. Also thier baby food procedes pet procedes back comnuity support rescues shelters. love support local comminuty. 

Yes know bit long but if shop all could probably ever it. Oh thier best buys doughnut special 7 pm. If any left its buy dozen free. sometimes bc close where live. Food fresh. Came day meat section stank rotten meat. Found moldy cakes once. produce sometimes wilted. Owner store jerk too. Ok...I place twice....its nearby never busy Von's across way. However reason lack traffic place into. first time just picking some beer girlfriend asked if could pick some other items. picked some bread some milk. home find bread already EXPIRED milk set expire NEXT DAY! WTH??? kind quality control there?? 

The place inside does look bit unkept clean would expect employees rather unfriendly don't seem all thrilled being there. 2nd time just stopped some wine wanted pick some tomatoes also salad. First 95% tomatoes verge being rotten other 5% way over ripe soft. really disgusting owners place allow sort situation take place but if read through some other reviews constantly see people advising watch expiration dates anything buy. 

My advice? Just FORGET DIRTY UNFRIENDLY SLIMEY place shop somewhere else....you glad did trust me!

P.S.Look article KTNV NEWS did place!!!! Further proof!!!

www.ktnv.com news contact 13 gross grocers bugs at glaziers First off I'd say much enjoy shopping Glaziers good selection product quality cleanliness!
After long days work last thing want grocery shopping. However trips Glaziers shopping easy task. pleased service Erik pizza deli area . friendliness professionalism made day! He's eager help treats customers most respect. definitely back again again type customer service!!!! prepared totally wowed Glazier's.  all all great reviews.  also listed every week RJ Wednesday Food section place find all those goodies back wherever came can't find Vegas.

Warm Springs Durango isn't anywhere near where live made day trip.  Yeah big.  Much bigger expected.  Minneola oranges sale very good price right near door where entered.  Then saw Acme Smoked Whitefish Salad thought I'd died gone heaven.  then...nothing.

Yes there's food court.  tasted gelato.  Okay but just.  tasted tuna salad deli.  Okay but Von's better.  New York potato salad ghostly white drowning mayo looked kind wouldn't touch Pathmark before its recent well deserved demise.  Away deli counter looked most any other supermarket.  Prices slightly lower some things higher most others.  

I'm thinking maybe when good sale really score here.  Maybe.  only glanced meat counter looked spectacular but rarely buy meat.

I did see few items back East know don't exist other local supermarket but they're stuff dreams made of.  say employees extremely friendly solicitous deserve big kudos.

I think Wegmanized.  Wegman's fabulously unique supermarket chain wended its way down upstate New York parts NJ PA no other.  close but outing look forward when back east.  can't say same Glazier's.  course unless unexpected craving Acme Smoked Whitefish.  But old pregnant. love salad bar here! Even though serve cold Dolma still pretty tasty. also mushrooms some artichokes. price $6.00 pound but very filling healthy. perfect place eat someone broke but would still nutritious meal. Came check wide variety gourmet foods available food court area everything looked very good fresh. bought some micro brewed sodas which hella tasty but hard find other regular supermarkets. Really impressed overall selections goods. Love here. lot east coast gooda. Ie Herrs brand. Fruit n meats always fresh. Customer service great...everyone polite. Pizza wednesdays awesome. actually ordered fried turkey Thanksgiving..and great. Definitely great supermarket. Deli good well...a lot choices. Bagels ok too...better any chain bagel shops. forgot much LOVE place seeing don't live southwest area anymore but worth drive! Prices steep commercial items however produce meat reasonably priced fresh. offer military discount Thursdays! Love place. Meat poultry fish departments very fresh deli awesome. produce outstanding. Great prices departments. Milk eggs cheese good price also. STAY AWAY SALAD BAR! food sever food poisoning 2 days. Looks good but trust stay away. shopping here. only thing could restock bit more sometimes certain things. Good priced tho. Now West side Vegas transplant originally Eastcyde finally taste good life ....I've chance explore new neighborhood its great!!! mean scenery westside breath taking....Red Rock canyon amazing....and though don't play golf courses seen wanna job driving around golf cart just actually see really green grass...you don't really see lot green grass Eastcyde but  talk about....I'm review lil gem
of grocery store called Glazier's....I LOVE PLACE....I mean never any store many good products sale...well besides Costco but  another story....the prices cheaper some other grocery stores to...and speciality items food items Hawaii.....ZIPPY'S CHILI!!!!! even saw guava sale produce section...the last time fresh guava when Maui picked off tree...now little pricey didn't buy any since baller budget but nice know items that...they even food court different food stations if you're lazy cook...the only thing don't other grocery stores club card...but since prices better they're competitors guess really don't need one....in any case love store...I definitely coming back  all grocery shopping needs!!! lot very diverse selections food extremely multi cultural regular grocery store. food very easy take home cook already made without hassle. Lots variety good prices. Also staff nice!! coming location outreach local charity owner greeted hard rudeness disrespect utilized term 'you people' when addressing group people mainly consisting minorities.  offended behavior Mr. Glazier immediately left outreach enraged sadden such lack respect human kind still around. place awesome.  came into store no expectations reading some negative reviews.  Right off bat impressed.  certain vegetables hard find its fresh form canned dried.  Also meat prices pretty fair priced.  place adventurous home cook wants more just regular meal. beer selection Glazier's worth review update alone. Last time surprised see Ranger IPA $7.99 $1 less Smith's regular price. Today even more surprised beer selection grown dramatically. maybe just never noticed before.

I picked 6 pack Deschutes Black Butte Porter $8.49. also carry Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale Inversion IPA. addition other brews New Belgium Stone carry Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA though comes hoppier price tag $10.99... IIRC .

Sure could find equal better selection Lee's Total Wine. But freakin' grocery store!

While review update mode another great thing Glazier's support local products. weekends various vendors handing samples à la Costco. particular owner selling family recipe BBQ sauce. label says Originated Grandpappy's Cattle Drive. Henderson Nevada. couldn't resist showing some love picking jar. If want enjoy your next gathering guest your own party Glaziers Food Market!  used them now 4 times made life easy.  Besides time buy everything you'd paying more cleanup mess afterwards.  Christmas dinners keep growing dinner guests buy Mrs. G's Complete Butterball Turkey Mrs. G's Prime Rib dinner both come everything 2 bottles Champagne each pie dessert.  also used butcher Crown Roast completely tied ready go.  Try it.  love it!  also prepared meals dining area terrific salad bar other goodies grab something eat there. Best grocery store town! Cheap but fresh produce. Boneless skinless chicken breast $2.48 lb. Specialty pastas I think they're made house . Boar's head deli meats. King's Hawaiian Rolls gf. love place glad live only mile away it. isn't usual grocery store but close office don't way if want stop Glazier's work. usual things grocery list milk juice bread eggs still grocery stores closest house because more convenient.

However reason love Glazier's because loss leaders best town. Whether chicken breasts steaks any other type meat advertised loss leader amazing value can't beat. Plus don't buy 20 pound package savings would chain grocery store. portions manageable don't defrost foam tray six days worth rib eye.  extremely important live alone.

I'm probably type customer Glazier's prefers. want shoppers come loss leaders then spend money other profit making items. Admittedly variety items Glazier's impressive carry lot unique things found anywhere else. However simple guy stock loss leader check then home. wallet thanks you. Seriously Impressed. Here's why. 

The Good Premade foods. lots lots choices. 
Lunchmeats Cheeses carry Boar's Head. full line it. when say full line can't justice. 
They carry odds ends can't find anywhere else. want Vienna Beef Chicago Style Hotdog Polish Sausage Dog? real thing. 
International food carry modest selection things seen elsewhere if live close save some time buying here. 
Like Apples? carry some varieties don't see very often. 

The Bad When look closer product mix weird. high end ultra high end stuff mixed Western Family Springfield generic lines. 
Good luck talking anyone butcher shop tried twice. 
The premade salads right front visual appeal Purina puppy chow splashed into dog's water bowl. Mushy yucky slimy bleech. 
Produce place carries international food produce section downright small limited. type eggplant example Albertsons carries more varieties. 
The piped music lulls semi consciousness don't notice problems store has.
They token beer wine selection barely warrants floor space cost liquor licenses maintain it. 

The Ugly Pricing. Does anyone Vegas comparison shop? If price conscious would spot things right away. didn't take time write down everything saw but could easily come 30 item list where prices 30 35 cents higher same items some things over $1 more saw some items way cheaper elsewhere Vegas saving $3 more per item. we're even going begin compare them Winco basic items. 
Produce Quality Overpriced overripe avocados shows someone isn't paying attention what's put display example several other quality problems store has. 

In short...count among unimpressed ones likely back. supermarket Best Las Vegas recipient since its opening serves breakfast weekends destination recent morning. found market comparable Whole Foods more moderate pricing. ordered counter then retired table piano room where food delivered. easy over eggs came bacon wheat toast home fries. ingredients good but pricing high execution left much desired. toast wasn't crispy bacon limp potatoes tired egg whites watery. Such shame place closing doors. love shopping specialty items organic deals. Now may some things usually Glaziers online sites. great place shop. sorry see them go. market best seafood meat department. meat always tender. seafood fresh. service excellent. 
I also produce area. Great selection fruits veggies. great deli meats well unbelievable potatoe salad. Yum! employees friendly too! Very happy place close home me! selection product great store very clean organized. love deli produce section. Everything always seems fresh clean. love grocery store try only shop here!

They amazing selection meats seafood huge selection ready eat meals.  If running behind place because dinner already made quality flavor great!

Prices very very competitve huge selection organics health conscious selections.  No frills just good prices.

The staff very friendly helpful.  love Glaziers! Disappointed new customer!

My first trip Glaziers yesterday overall really liked store selection great products sold there.

However very disappointed discover bakery using highly controversial ingredient sandwich steak rolls! Azodicarbonamide legally banned considered toxic some countries!

I ask Glaziers IMMEDIATELY PERMANENTLY remove Azodicarbonamide ALL its products!

Thank really dislike store. employees seem miserable including big tall manager mopes around cart no personality... security front store intimidating treat everyone if they're stealing prices inflated sell rotten wilted produce regularly. bought moldy grapes bag moldy tomatoes last visit... nerve sign outside establishment saying Voted Best Vegas ... voted Stevie Wonder? am moving area near Glazier's think am more ecited being closer place am new house. come high quality produce. noticed when other grocer's products aren't looking well Glazier's still beautiful products. prepared food also really good. usually don't eat grocery store sushi but wasn't bad. pizza place awsome deli. Count people love place. Love Glazier's. Love all prepared food options selection general. always pleasant shopping experience here. A+ first time trying grocery store. would compare WholeFoods far style goes. When walked did hit strong fish smell but guess happens when many fresh varieties choose from. browsed around entire store seemed pretty much everything. produce department huge great prices weekly specials. far pricing throughout rest store did notice them higher then say national chain grocery store Walmart. If able spend little extra worth given entire store maintained extremely well large building which feel less crowded staff friendly. Those little creature comforts may worth some. Overall great first time experience definitely looking weekly ads produce more often! supermarket rocks! everything imagine more. sisters came visit Orange County both vegans strict diets. Glaziers wide variety organic gluten free vegan options. Just downside many organic produce. 

Wednesday night 2 8pm pizza night. Can't large 16in 1 topping 5.99?! 
Garlic crust just hits off!!

Friday night steak night! Juicy steak corn potatoes side. serve meal deal 4 8. while can! always come 15 minutes before closing still cooked fresh shop!! The weekend serve breakfast! sure hours because breakfast person. enjoyed time. good hearty morning fill up. 


The staff friendly. mean very friendly. regulars see crazy 2 year old running aisles often. They've even helped find keys daughter lost them cart! 


Overall store shop if certain dietary needs want change busy regular chain markets just need quick meal whip up.. place! best grocery store Vegas. didn't believe said much either. 

The first couple times impressed selection I hunting watercress found $2 head didn't even notice great prices. grateful such awesome selection close new house. When noticed specials couldn't believe it. don't know offer such hard to find produce such good prices especially desert. 

This place Vegas real city lifelong supporter! If live anywhere near store eating then definitely trip won't regret it. store close home place really good meat besides butcher shop Rainbow . coming staple refrigerator some time now disappoint. Additionally many other things pinch if necessary but doing some price comparison shopping other places noticed little higher other places things. say veggie bar  over Deli area. come some side dishes when hurry Garlic Mushrooms many many recipes seem well in. awesome garlic knots cooler near where sell cooked pizzas pizzas fixings your own. Also Gallo White Zin when am tighter budget 2.76 I think everyday week since going all Galo wines some moscato now then well. LOVE grocery store! 

NO crazy cheap if thats want then Walmart.

Bought cake son's birthday party absolutely amazing! great price tasted wonderful!! While pick mom grabbed some lunch. She enjoyed two sushi dishes panini. Just wonderful! Exactly would find typical restaurant grocery store. 

No never greeted security upon entrance but every single employee encountered wonderful. Some may say overpriced but quality food worth it. multiple facets freshly made food daily local residents well exquisite food court options grocery store very unique. Also Mr Glazier himself big into fundraising events helping local charities. If would some kosher chicken breasts well kosher beef place would perfecto! highly recommend grocery store great options fresh food amazing quality around world. Glazier's best market Las Vegas.  somewhat toned down Whole Foods.  wide array selections available eat now much Whole Foods but won't cost your Whole Paycheck it? .  seafood selection actually larger Whole Foods meat selection very nice too.  

When walk around Glazier's notice much different your neighborhood market but small details Glazier's different.  example walking back section see many exact brands see most market but then see Chinese Sausage.  random but ridiculously cool thing find supermarket.  

I usually spend hour Glazier's because takes 30 minutes just meat fish want.  also really Family Meal Deal's have.  deals change weekly but usually something like buy 5# beef roasts bag potatoes 6 pack waters 12 pack bread rolls package lettuce 1# bag carrots BBQ sauce free .  usually aren't quite random example but point.  usually only spend $10 roast may bough way bunch stuff free.  Great deal.  

I live other side town east tropicana still come once week grocery shopping.  definitely worth it! just moved May 2017. Spent entire summer looking buy house found one. Early summer visited your store suggestion neighbors. 
My favs REAL New York bagels frozen New York. numerous cheeses. Wisconsin sausages. Deep dish frozen pizza Chicago. tell traveled life? 
The sauces!! Everything. 
Great affordable everyday wines. 
The bakery!!! Although don't delve much. 
Overall....I placed once month shopping trip items sold anywhere else plus great prices. 
I don't shop National large stores over decade now. 
I saw your post Facebook Vegas Fox stating due health reasons. me....health everything hope turns good. Prayers thank you. 
I retired Vegas enjoying local suburbs stores restaurants. 
Thank you. grocery store great variety high quality food. ate sushi bar panini stand really good but think sushi sitting awhile because kind dry. try again though! If you're looking specialty foods place OK.  But unless you're rich great place weekly grocery shopping.  Meats seafood really good.  Good deli area well.  Produce surprisingly limited.  side they're few places carry Tasty Cakes one few good things other soft pretzels come Philly .  come once every 4 months stock Krimpets but  it. grocery store huge variety items can't find elsewhere NY pasta Hawaiian section etc... also hot ready food purchase salad bar cute dining area eat your food.. Oh really Boar's head ordering system.
They seem usually really good deals items produce... only gripe place fresh products noticed rotten very fast.. also seen multiple refrigerated items beef cheese mold ... just sure pay attention everything buy... LOL 

Hot tip Weekends almost many samples Costco yummm DELI DEPARTMENT

What attitude lack knowledge deli people??? asking two deli employees simple question where Gouda cheese? told needed ask store manager did know. Deli department meat cheese right???! 

So picked few non deli items check out. told cashier happened she stated she heard deli people rude. Then 3 stand customers joined conversation. confused....within short time leaving store  encountered 4 other people same story nasty deli employees are. return. Seriously why don't Glazier's Food Marketplace near home? Bristol Farms Whole Foods Gelson's rolled into without attitude high prices. dream grocery store.

They everything could ask for...a crazy selection every prepared food could want including seating area baby grand piano...yeah freakin' piano ice cream counter including gelato full service bakery full service meat counter including sausage factory beautiful cheese selection huge liquor wine section large selection groceries international foods gluten free foods fresh produce. All grocery goodness comes reasonable price staff friendly helpful.

Glazier's everything could ask neighborhood grocery store...except fact 255 miles house. *sadface* family orders pizza sometimes say delicious....Aaand even big fan pizza review Glazier's Bakery only. great experience bad experience Sam's Club Bakery.  Placed order Iggy very friendly helpful. He called few days later ask picture showed he could ensure cupcake order came exactly wanted to. Picked order few days later cupcakes perfect design just envisioning cupcakes fresh tasted great. price right too! definitely return next Bakery needs. Thanks Iggy great service! When into store really happy find foods haven't seen long time even hoped  eventually San Diego.  visiting bought several groceries take home foods can't find where am. 
Unfortunately when home started eating some crackers very bad taste looked expiration date expired two months prior which leads believe often check shelves other expired food did consume

Too bad back visiting September hoping return buy more goodies. people super friendly giving real neighborhood market feel.  selections awesome though prices above Smiths Vons but still below Whole Foods.  kiosk deli place order come back later pick which awesome. seafood counter favorite. sell whole lobsters price which $13.  also lobster tails sometimes $5!! Love place! grocery store but love coming because amazing selection pre prepared food choices. donut case enticing! produce affordable fantastic sales! lot local items lot items can't anywhere else Vegas! always just fun stroll aisles see find! Definitely recommend! favorite grocery store Vegas meat wine!  also monthly wine cheese party café if want try before buy then check that.  Great choice fruits veggies well several pre made dishes if cook too! LOVE Glaziers! feel big chain but family cares only old stand but some cool local odd stuff tossed in. couldn't explain why loved much took daughter she can't explain either. just cool.
 fresh salad bar bakery lunch counter. Booze vegies gluten free local coffee stuff most people shopping too.
 never wait long line when question bleep veggie?? always someone there.
 Parking lot giant cool stores nearby Home Goods clothes. DAY going quick two items. heck gone home but close place always running anyway. otherwise would invent reasons far. Thank goodness hasn't xome that! use LOVE glaziers. Seriously favorite store all time. Unfortunately most shocking experience ever today. walked into glaziers husband infant stopped told couldn't into store because diaper bag. Wait what? can't shop because infant's diaper bag? suppose just carry baby's formula diapers wipes? most absurd thing ever heard life especially coming VERY loyal customer. would shop least twice week. today longer going glaziers neither family. Terrible service. unfortunate. writes review grocery store? ME. don't live Las Vegas but visit often stay right around corner Glazier's. LOVE IT. would rather come eat. salad bar amazing always fresh crisp. produce selection phenomenal decently priced. cheapest food ever seen. Granted live very small town few options could exaggerating awesomeness. But if lived would regularly shop eat here! concluded Glazier's really best grocery store Las Vegas.  Yes usual selection produce canned goods meats dairy frozen etc. but then serve hot prepared food steak night Friday lots stuff bakery breads donuts tried taste them came real bakery rather supermarket department.  

The clincher though only grocery store Las Vegas huge selection chip brands Wise Herr's.  Yummy flavors unavailable other more common manufacturers. When moved Vegas South Carolina told many Glaziers best store area. While nice store great fresh food options also left wanting more. prices best seems every time spend more would if Von's across street same items. keep shopping occasionally some fresh foods but rest just across street. don't live anywhere close but some friends neighborhood made some stops supplies when we're meeting place dinner. 

The deli large gotten few salads BBQs pretty good. Better most grocery delis. stopped quick things chips hummus that Eves brand delicious! whatever else can't judge full perspective but positive far gotten. There's definitely variety brands don't see elsewhere mixed typical stuff. variety person plus me. 

Since hanging down more often sure stopping more regularly maybe days shopping down weeks groceries see people raving about. usually love Glaziers always good selection healthy produce  basically all purchase. Except mushrooms mushrooms always bad second trip across street Vons just mushrooms. normally basket produce through self checkout quickly. 

Today different experience. self check out lanes closed all four them. 2 afternoon sure why would closed but were. then wait line checked out. cashier younger gal another younger gal bagging. set basket conveyer belt waited turn. When turn bagger said Switch two young ladies switched positions. bagger now becoming cashier. She finishing previous customers check out even talking looking him. When turn didn't hello acknowledgement eye contact Did find everything okay nothing. She seemed mad. Told total annoyed voice her. Then bagging gal tried hand back basket bags inside it. just looked finally said don't want basket. cashier gal told don't take baskets. reached over grabbed bags basket discover she put two heaviest items bag two very light items another bag. basically carrying air side having shoulder pulled socket other side. need cashiers some training. hope self check outs opened again soon. second pretty much everything Misty said. really nice grocery store definately plus if live surrounding area. don't live all far away but just far enough where its bit inconvenience travel Glaziers. would probably pass 7 8 other supermarkets way.

Its nicer version Albertsons. Some prices good some bit much expected place only location . bit suprised quiet Friday night around 7 pm. Usually time line people getting groceries weekend.

Major plus now sell Drakes Cakes thanks Matt finding out . Drakes Cakes Little Debbies Hostess those unfamiliar. Anyway only place town that know of sells them. double price back east but fix every once while huge bonus!

Did small shopping only grabbed things sale. Some regular stuff lot cheaper fresh easy wal mart which closer house. 

Very nice store though definately lot bigger thought would be. Better most big chain market huge deli food hall set up.  Arrangement market odd does facilitate flow.  Staff great always smiling asking if could help.  Some part market could use re organizing bit warehouse ish.  Sushi sub part but inexpensive.  Rotisserie chicken very good.  Fried fish frozen box don't expect much.    all experienced far add more later.  
A nice food shopping experience certainly nicer Vons across street. frequent place almost every day neighbourhood spot having dealt Vons' Albertsons' Walmarts Vegas past 8 years nice personalized really local grocery pays attention its clients they take requests carry items... actually folllow through! . also carry lots items haven't seen elsewhere fair prices. crazy good prices produce shop seasonally chicken can't found cheaper anywhere else. run frequent sales specials just all around shopping experience much more pleasant if shop mindfully just following all frequent specials you'll end varied thorough bountiful cart all kinds useful deliciuos stuff every week. staff friendly just look all feel they're big family head honcho Mr. Glazier himself sometimes browsing around shopping cart full paperwork checking see if everything order. Very reassuring.

BUT... love letter DONUTS. Little known secret think which blast wide open. aren't your typical miniscule Krispy Kreme puffed air sugar coated morsels. donuts heft them when walk 0745 smelling bakery goodness air know they're warm fresh ready presentation. 

Get them morning take few your coworkers they'll thank you. They're huge covered just enough glaze depending type lightly crisp outside but incredibly pillowy soft inside texture goddamn pleasure sink your teeth into. Every person brought donuts immediately demands know where them. But  all awesome flavors too. Nowhere else found flavors pineapple blueberry fritters red velvet cake donuts maple walnut fritters a personal fave blueberry jelly donuts. maple chocolate swirl could swear more chocolatey more maple y any other version tried bonus incredible doughnut dough supporting all. If you're fiend traditional apple fritter place carries huge crisp delicious version. But try pineapple it'll rock your world. 

Bottom line carry lots great stuff great prices but unusual plus array atypically delicious DONUTS. eating right now. Thought I'd share really selection ready heat items.  also lot specialty food brands cant find regular grocery stores Vegas. Tuesday night 10 00. close midnight. little surprised lot things already put away blocked off couldn't particular area store. wanted some olives olive  bar but all closed up. Also prices pretty high some items. occasionally but shop regularly because prices. Four stars because selection nice clean store. tried place but impossible love. many expired stale items really careful buying here. Also every way turn hand written signs saying sample something effect. Everywhere!

I almost give them 3 stars though because 2 items which keep coming back baklava cannolli. Yum! careful bakery display cases though very very stale! speaking stale there's always sample offered bakery same thing every visit less 1 square dry white bread. Really?

When asked register if any clearance areas store told didn't need them because sell things fast. Right. jaw dropped walked into amazing store! store holds products every generic supermarket has. felt though combination Vons 99 Ranch Market Cardenas all rolled into amazing store! Chefs culinary students like myself could find anything need exquisite meal! Still waiting Henderson location open! know sprouts where planning building Green Valley Horizon Ridge but hopeful Henderson location still coming. love store but just don't very often bc long drive. couple months trek pretty soon. Glazier's produce Hawaiian sections fantastic. Glazier's stays away unionized produce which usually results much lower prices selection ample. look forward shopping Glazier's every pay day. summers comprise late nights driving various places city. Surprisingly enough Sin City doesn't many places midnight don't involve liquor. But loved going Glazier's friends hours. 

The croissants die for. Buttery flaky definitely calorie laden. premise driving Glazier's until walked around. only way describe Whole Foods meets Wal Mart all best ways. Prepared food feast eyes wrapped around corners everywhere look. produce reasonably priced ethnic food selection quite impressive being suburbia. 

Glazier's favorite supermarkets town. If only lived closer I'd all time however waistline am grateful not. love place!! 

Like all super markets prices ok unless things sale gonna address that. place special different counters offer. 

Produce when sale great prices fresh stuff buy lasts longer other groceries. 

Gelato chocolate don't even sweets but great overly sweet nice bitter bite. 

Sandwhiches jersey sasndwhich italian great boars head meats aged provolone if tried great cheese only thing ok bread same level ingredients. 

Pizza best but $5.99 wednesdays its best bang your buck wednesday. 

Flowers wife seems arrangements gotten each time guess good wife jsut happy any flowers me. far best grocery store Vegas.  good amount everything need.  love deli section liquor section. 

They also offer Chicago Style pizza which really hard find.  

Good prices. love place esp late night. Never crowded. Always clean. 
I come mostly seafood. Tuna crabs salmon. Im also fan tge cold pasta salad. Super yummy!
And course just pass fritters. big face! esp strawberry blueberry. Apple? much! 
Its close house too. 2 thumbs up! Cross butcher Wal Mart prices awesome crap Bacon Salt Cap'n Crunch Whole Foods healthy stuff Glazers. favorite grocery store town. wish they'd build central Las Vegas. Glazier's mom pop grocery store steroids  in good way. interesting Las Vegas business phenomenon back in business retirees people move Las Vegas retire but them become bored reopen business. Glazier's brilliant businesses. Helen Bill Glazier owned several grocery stores Pennsylvania before retiring Las Vegas subsequently opening some grocery stores! 

I wish closer home could regular shopping ground. store big spacious clean. prices affordable.  every flier seen family meal deal. example buy 3lb package pork chops 5lbs potatoes green beans bag salad dozen dinner rolls jar applesauce free!

The selection vast. always read people finding products Glazier's can't find anywhere else especially east coast specialties. store features several counters order ready to eat food pizza fried shrimp sandwiches sushi ice cream. Once grab meal little area booths player piano  snazzy! only thing did look appealing pre made salad counter. Some salads look sitting bit. should just stir 'em prevent them getting filmy look. 

We left some cheap tasty sandwich buns some bagels. bagels little disappointing but overall would happy if Glazier's moved closer house! place good selection fruits veggies discounted greeting cards stock variety items can't find other stores Jay's potato chips which told East Coast thing.  

I enjoy soothing music Trader Joe's Whole Foods feel place without hefty price tag. Love grocery store delicious food worth trip. frequently always feel good when home. Definitely pricey brand name aisle food. Nice store personal feel. lot specialty items here. big deli bakery meat counter individualize your shopping. even steak night little cafe area piano playing sit eat. used shop Glaziers all time few years ago when lived Silverado Ranch area.  recall always seemed good deals good produce.

This weekend 4th July fella stopped take look meat selection grill off competition participating in.  

First all selection seafood department!!  huge slab yellowtail Tuna although heard another Yelper really good HUGE shrimp looked amazing lobster tails king crab clusters not just legs monkfish!  never seen monkfish anywhere $7 pound 4 pieces delightful lunch.

We also found veal chops which fella never seen before.  chops inch thick asked guys behind counter if could custom cut inch half us.  more happy showing meat where would cut prior doing it.  

This right prefer Glazier's over Smith's.  Smith's guys working meat department high school kids don't know Cowboy cut is.  guys actually KNOW doing know meat different cuts etc.  

I am definitely thinking start shopping more frequently again.  

The produce looked great picked broccolini endive which haven't seen many other stores. best butcher seafood department found Vegas! 0 fishy smell everything impeccably clean selection oh ! husband taken back all beautiful meats he insisted grill pronto. sausage factory? 96% Lean ground beef under $3? heaven. only visit meat seafood mecca but seems highlight store.

Next impression quite impressed bakery. bread bought oh soft delicious. Great selection cakes baked goods under $5. know where next time feel OK consuming extra 2000 cals sitting. 

So far overly impressed rest store. no membership card I hate those! but selection random things shredded cheese flavored creamer say crescent rolls wasn't nearly good Smith's yup weird shopping list! . 

The low point wine selection. Smith's more wine price better 10% discount buying 6 wines once. selection awful all grocery store brands nothing cool independent. expected some cool wine such huge store ! Prices all regular wines $1 $2 more then NO DISCOUNT. 

Overall Come meats seafood wine ! Awesome place! told couple years. Finally first time loves it! won't any where else now on. If haven't owe yourself check out. GREAT PIZZA best Vegas! Items Selected Pancakes Strawberries

Having thought exhausted Valley's list Doughnut shops over past two years recommendation friend Glazier's Food Marketplace identified another source novel fried dough recalling Donut Mania's owner once suggested he originally helped establish grocery store's program just 7 00am Saturday stop made cabinets well stocked most options still warm.

Advertising whole new lineup including four types fritters along store's recently launched weekend brunch admittedly some surprise Glazier's collection tallied more two dozen variations ranging cake yeast filled frosted 89 to 99 cent prices far cry many other artisan purveyors results ranging downright excellent subpar grocery store stuff.

Holding off moment before exploring donuts total eleven selected largely result space  per cardboard box could help but wonder 702s Best Supermarket would fare terms made to order options taking easy way offering fake syrup cold pat butter alongside pancakes dry literally crumbled fork pressure answer simply summed horrible $8.57 waste money more 3 4 deposited trash.

Onward better things payment automated checkout fairly simple before returning table indulge opening bites raised options spoke brioche base similar Donut Mania Pinkbox just bit more tooth blueberry coconut bit artificial its flavor while cream filled rings coffee well chocolate fared far better espresso infused glaze particularly robust.

Unabashedly fond fritters sentiment many share suffice say those cite oiliness reason displeasure need fear ones Glazier's actually much 'lighter' average yet although attempt raise stakes multiple flavors indeed appreciated substantial lack whole fruit beneath double shellacking sugary sweet glaze most certainly pineapple particularly affronting its lack flavor vast majority each left box.

Rounding morning cocoa rich red velvet cake made wish more classics including old fashioned buttermilk bar amidst group perhaps good fortune two bars tangy Key Lime Pie complete graham cracker crumble saved last lemon filling beneath white frosting rainbow sprinkles impressive its tartness while shredded coconut cream amidst dark chocolate reminisced Mounds Bar all right ways sliced and filled presentation assuring perfect ratio each ingredient throughout.

More modestly priced other places offering novelty donuts but same time always executing level shows creativity matched quality staff those planning visit Glazier's Donuts encouraged choose carefully while those looking pancakes fritters should steer clear visit almost anywhere else. Made order breakfast sandwiches waffles weekend Glazier's!  Matcha DIRTY green tea latte made Roberta coffee bar place incredible! pretty much everything possibly imagine grocery store times ten. meat section huge freshly baked bread salad bar quick meals. prices super cheap but selection insane. Even evening still selection fresh cakes meats pastries available. wasn't any more freshly baked bread when though. Everything store clean well stocked. Checkout fast. more ask grocery store? Great go to if actually lived Vegas. Found most chicago favorites. Wasn't even over priced when figure import all. regular Midwest prices. everything store would five star but produce does last beyond day two once home.  If buy produce better use day.  Very poor quality produce.  However Deli rocks! worst place ever worked worked 9 months produce department owner would stand end aisle stare 2 hours making very uncomfortable workplace everyday wages very low no health insurance work holidays 4 straight pay Thanksgiving Christmas regular pay employees cattle everybody quit buy lower grade produce 15 pallets rotten potatoes call shelter come pick smell bad during grand opening told he take back East mentality back where he came people Las Vegas won't put he treats employees going steal would recommend seeking employment elsewhere really bad 35 years grocery store worst back again believing experience may different but turned worse. head manager Leona such B*TCH! She no respect anybody but herself seems when asked where item she looked disgust rolled eyes then proceeded ignore me. going complaint BBB because customer service horrendous. just shocked rude people are. never store where everyone rude disrespectful. never shopping again. Thumbs Glazier's... just grocery but big fat thumbs quick work lunches lazy housewife dinners!!!

Gosh thought reviewed already... I'd jerk if didn't mention first speeding ticket coming here... please 35 mph stretch Warm Springs   cops camp all time quick buck or $180 if 44 did . But anywho... 

Pastries? Cookies every kind muffin breads cakes pies Pastries big bad beautiful.

From East Coast? Plenty  brands thought could only find home.

On your lunch hour? Almost every lunch craving satisfied if walk left.... even dine listen some piano. 
They great salad bar options pizza sushi chicken fingers coffee ice cream even fried shrimp couple times. Otherwise plenty pre made meals sides bring home heat up.

Their  breads tamales prepared meats fresh made pastas sauces hit house. addition finding specialty brands items easily find pre made goodies great substitute cooking your family dinner long arduous work day. plenty options aren't available usual suspects groceries. Think marinades spices.

My gripe obviously cost  while completely outrageous... cheap either. staple items may your regular grocery list rarely less your chain supermarket Think cereal snack food . But seriously  if time plan time  could both.  then there's produce... while extensive   fan  spend wayyyy much time finding good onion... won't mention long took find decent pear.

I would highly recommend stopping lunch. would recommend checking your next shopping trip.

Glaziers homey mom pop grocery store  pretty rare parts. cleanest grocery store Las vegAs.
Great customer service.
They always more then two cashiers open.
Open late holidays.
It's never crowded. Smiths Walmart packed.
I always store.
Their prices great well shop Glazier's regularly three years. some fantastic experiences some negative experiences here.

1. produce usually good. good sales peppers red yellow orange green .88 cents pound. 10 limes dollar. package small heirloom tomatoes $1 in summer . Sometimes bad when whole area avocados ripe. fact herbs arent very good.

2. deli prepared meals section fantastic. really enjoy fact order phone little kiosk. problem cheapest sliced meat offer $8.99 lb WOW. fantastic cheese  almost anything could want.

3. Meat area. usually great variety prepackaged meats reasonable price. only problem meat section rude customer service. ordered some bacon other day guy behind counter didn't say single word me. He also preoccupied staring front store door area. strange. 

FYI food poisoning recently bacon!! also couple friends food poisoning bacon salad bar! Buyer eater beware!!

4. Customer service. where lose whole star me. Usually super friendly. If want them carry new item customer service ask 90% time start carry which why such large variety food .

The negative couple girls completely rude. example buying forumla manufactuer's coupon which check COUPON husband's name girl told take that. asked why she said trying cash check someone else's name call cops arrested if try again. UM WHAT! First all girl should asked your manager further clarification manufactuer's coupon is.

Bottom line customer service isn't great but some products worth it... sometimes. bought mud pie when eat next day completely moldy. emailed contact form off website no response. Health food other region items affordable! lesson learned Glazier. Just long somewhere else produce. Walking through section disappointing when look everything else. 

This grocery store carries good selection ethnic goods food stuff east coast. am always trying healthy eater Glazier might another step right direction.

I love Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar drinks but Glazier took step further carrying pure solution mix own. $6 20+ drinks. alone screams saving since bottle premix drink cost $2.50. might sound good first but taste more tart apple cider. Just follow instructions vinegar bottle.

On top discovery nice food court. gelato caught eyes but full try. love Glazier's happy street home.
It's little taste PA Las Vegas still waiting Yuengling .
Great staff service. Some prices bit high but sales outstanding.
My favorite find lobsters priced great they'll steam them free!
Their bakery rocks doughnuts...go early freshest best variety soft delicious.
You even eat lunch dinner their...pizza fish chips sushi salad sandwiches etc.
Hope stick around. love cook usually cook very well guess having world class chefs friends learn thing two. However getting right ingredients impossible most grocery stores geared towards single people housewives trying cook between crying kids juggling husband boyfriends right ingredients quality main concern. Glazier market just opposite offers fantasy land experience foodies chefs. extensive line products San Marzano tomatoes fresh pastas many varieties also nice Greek Midwestern food.  meat fish department okay. wish fishes fresh frozen. open till midnight every day great parking great place shop. also great food court.  recommend grocery store. Really enjoy shopping when Vegas. selection far exceeded local supermarkets great change pace. prepared foods section very good even place eat right store. meat fish section large fresh. Prices little higher. Whole Foods level. Very nice people helpful finding looking for. husband some first dates walking isles local grocery stores Hawaii looking available. knew then food first love would play part relationship years later still fun searching grocery store isles. 

Glazier's food marketplace very unique store walking seeing hay stacked around old truck know isn't usual grocer. Once enter introduced freshest produce. boxes stacked brightest golden yellow vivid red emerald green bell peppers sometimes fresh berry's. Your eyes jumping around all baskets stacked boxes barrels vegetables fruits. Finally your eyes find white sign placed before object delight see price take double take then moment disbelief before realize misprint. Prices reasonable. 

If veer off left entrance find fresh food counters gelato sushi drinks sandwiches straight ahead baby grand piano have yet see anyone playing it surrounded tables chairs eating your fresh bought salad salad bar fresh baked double chocolate cookies donuts bakery. large selection fresh cheeses sausages even found beloved pimiento cheese spread childhood memory spread toast great sandwich . 

As your way around back store find meat counter display fresh meats fishes. If want food basket you. fairly decent wine selection comprehensive international area covering several isles rest store just any other grocery store exception Hawaii products if check freezer isle find Zippi's chili Redondo's Portuguese sausage even siamin noodles. 

If come regularly find some really good deals purchase $25 pick least two free items change weekly family meal deal. bit off beaten path Warm Springs Durango tend stay more north 215 but since far try least monthly.   very clean friendly store worth stopping in. only visit specific items can't find anywhere else nearby don't mind so so service if don't deal often. Just pointer all check your cake if you're buying fresh fruit strawberry cake picked today spoiled.  turn back around new one. 

Also found annoying second trip during exchange transaction clerk carrying personal conversation another employee even took moment herself laugh lay head down smack counter.  place look messy unprofessional especially no apology even acknowledging purchased something shouldn't even out. Glazier's favorite close affordable grocery store. Free samples good prices polite people working there. If could somehow find way rid morons picketing front it'd even better.
It's kind combination between regular grocery store Whole Foods Trader Joe's good fresh produce decent prices.
So happy opened store gave another close grocery store option rather inflated prices Von's across street where employees aren't very polite.
My only real complaint used favorite ice cream crazy cheap price but raised competition's price lately customer service above average. appreciate take requests grocery items etc. prices competitive however unfortunate sometimes find items organic vegetarian aisle cheaper Vons. keeps coming back? deli. love Boar's Head cheese. Especially smoked Gouda. Yesterday first time Glaziers. kind hidden gem Vegas. overall impression place awesome. write more thorough review few more grocery visits when enough time shop around take all in. Horrible customer service cashiers management. Produce always bad few days buying it. interaction today cashier disrespected front manager well manager didnt anything but smirk... Its worth money pay product believe going while but recently really gone down hill! love Sprouts but favorite local grocer. always great produce specials. staff friendly helpful. Boars Head selection amazing. salads delicious. products available anywhere else city. former NYer Detroiter much fun shop here. ordered couple large pizzas over telephone quoted 20 minutes. arrived store 25 minutes when approached pick counter..  found pizzas haven't even yet gone into oven. 
The gentleman working department very courteous apologized stating very busy night Halloween let know would 10 more minutes... 20 minutes now annoyed. approached guest services explaining situation quoted correct wait time over telephone would picked food elsewhere. woman seemed uninterested inconvenience offered no solution. 
I back pizza counter.. waited another 10 minutes going 45 minutes now food should've ready when arrived I look over notice woman guest services heavyset man 100 feet away just staring into direction. approach man woman before could begin speaking.. heavyset man leaning shopping cart he's using walker starts barking he OWNER watching new employee he aware situation. He explain pizza shops all over town just busy. 
I suggested he ask employees quote longer wait time over phone avoid inconveniencing customers. 
I'm completely appalled Mr. Glazier's doesn't give shit attitude towards inconvenienced customer instead helping overworked employee.. Mr. Glazier would rather just stare down employee intimidate instead figure solution helping out. 
I feel absolutely awful anyone works man.
Lastly pizzas free as should been ... glad because Little Caesar's better pie..  saying much. store best town.  If something want you. Food always fresh cakes baked goods also good Love love love store. Everything always fresh clean. staff all departments very nice. mostly deal guys making pizza. Some friendliest funniest bunch. family night couple pizzas take home realizing time closed. made anyway poor guy around guy cleaning floors. No other grocery store would given kind customer service. great job steaks steak night weekend breakfast. love international selection foods too. just can't find certain things instance favorite knish anywhere else.

It's true some non sale prices high side some all but priced high Whole Foods just good quality. again lots items sale really good prices.

I just wish they'd open branch Henderson  I'd shop all time. appreciate Cincinnati style chili. Hard find since left town.
The employees very helpful cool seeing owner sitting food court everyday talking staff friends. nice change pace usual bland supermarket chains. Sort Whole Foods Trader Joe's steroids! Why would remove rack potato chips near sandwich section? zero sense. hunt down 99 cent bag aisle five while sandwich being made. heard store Bosco chocolate syrup some.  briefly toured store prices selection seem very good.  glad when open new store Henderson. every week walk into grocery store advertise hoagies hero's sandwiches which ever want call them 
Bores Heads meat French bread. Made order.

Well surprise well above expected 
The French bread seemed freshly baked extras very fresh 
The sandwich whole fabulous east coaster well worth going back for. 
A little pricey the.40 meat but boars heads expect price difference 

Let add grocery store Drakes Tasty cakes Philadelphia New York area $5.99 cheese pizza Wednesdays. best but more worth price!

Wide selection ready made sweets treats much better most other generic ones found grocery stores of course comparable dedicated cake shops site bakeries but don't pay much . Best Food Marketplace ever! Good fresh vegetables fruits good prices! Great wine prices.
 Awesome place! nice living right around corner place. Some food prices higher Wal Mart but much more convenient. 

hey best prices meat. only once.  looks pretty good most part.  take bake vegetarian pizza.  making noticed second label under price tag.  While pizza oven peeled top label off found re dated!!  previous sell date already passed new date printed top label.
The pizza tasted terrible.      

Since tis only visit could isolated incident. honest only came because reading them taking fraudulent participants Extreme Coupon show. 

My sister boyfriend said weirdest vibe. does. don't really place. supposed similar Whole Foods what? Honestly reminds less well let Super Mex grocery store because food court like atmosphere end store Albertsons mixed fancy exterior.

The prices strange. Some items relatively cheap wine others astronomically overpriced organic specialty items compared other grocery stores.

I ended buying spices incorrectly assumed olive oil. should known despite signage 500 mL olive oil less $5 would good true. Emblazoned across bottle large letters olive oil. tiny letters label mentions canola blend. UGH! can't cook toxic canola sure going it. Maybe use moisturizer?

There wasn't enough store stop again groceries. place great food but kind overpriced other stuff besides that. Place real clean customer service excellent. Definately place buy food if live southwest area! Glazier's Food Marketplace good grocery shop. location perfect. area clean enough employees very helpful. ask any question you'll your answer immediately. find big selection meat seafood. also lot veggies fruits reasonable prices. find yummy sweets cakes cupcakes cookies... plenty organic food organic brown eggs organic bread . Everything conveniently located easy find. little fact very important me. If you've never store must check out... store carries Drake's products.   Devil Dogs Ring Dings Sunny Doodles Coffee Cakes all found here! stopped just Drake's products. Now back explore store see other products back East carry. am wondering if carry Rubinsteins Salmon Mr Mustard Progresso Macaroni Bean Soup? Things find anywhere Las Vegas. Finally buys things need sauce taste back east! When made through door shock finally felt home! did full lap without wagon take all in. mother law told place before but never went. Really ? Every time someone tells somewhere because just New York never is!! first visit Christmas eve dinner feast seven fishes. Italian traditional Christmas eve dinner! Everything perfect! just Glaziers yesterday ordering daughters birthday cake sure amazing! If market trust won't disappointed! yourself some Entenmans coffee cake chock full nuts coffee tell them sent you!! Ciao place because variety freshness. give three stars because deli constantly behind orders. usually put order computer store then continue shopping. usually say estimate long your order take but every time takes long. wait 45 minutes just cheese! little sadder now closing items starting run out. turning into another Smith's. RIP Glaziers. nice mom pop grocery store located Durango Warm Springs plaza but there's just something stands out. Love little organic section but also wishing bigger. right kind organic red delicious apples again .

I haven't any issues regards staff. They're would expect typically pretty nice overall. No complaints far.

They're also open till midnight any late shoppers. Sign weekly email check website weekly specials. prices usually comparable others. Mixed bag some great deals strawberries sale looked ok avocados also pretty good deal. But raspberries which sale gross all packages moldy fruit them yuck. Selection some areas vegetarian vegan fairly lacking. Service nice though  both checkout person someone took buggy both pleasant deal with. absolutely love place!! Being New Yorker love find specific food items cannot find anywhere else. love family owned. produce prices amazing!!! only reason gave four stars every time employee complaining work. just unprofessional really inviting. They're all way but should saying front customers. Maybe crazy thinking that. love place.  Friday Steak Nights deal $8.88 NY Strip rosemary potatoes corn cob.  Cooked perfectly seasoned!  early enough grab scoop gelato drive home.  If steak isn't your thing try super big cheese pizza $20!!!  mean BIG pizza!!  Thinking may fit car big! Glazier's grocery store located corner Warm Springs Durango always pretty cool store shop in. list themselves Kind Supermarket pretty darn close especially since open 6am 12am 7 days per week!

The store just everything looking for. great vegetable section standard grown organic items. Bakery huge some special imported New York Bagels cookies specialty donuts standard commercial company donuts. New York Deli section seems almost endless options always two sections deli where items food purchased spot eat within food area. 

The meat seafood areas just same many options fresh seafood meats. old style Butcher Shop where actually cut meats package them wait. 
They also offer standard packaged meats seafood. 
There large area alcohol which includes beer wine right next area specialty area ethnic foods different countries. 

The rest store standard layout its dairy juices frozen foods cosmetics shampoos dog foods toiletries. 

Overall prices just tad higher other stores but if sales shopper certainly good budget shopping done meat seafood times sale. 

The overall vibe store similar WholeFoods Trader Joes certainly par those types supermarkets offering quality items.

Parking lot easy ample space. RedBox location inside. LV YELPERS D

I'm sure why people picketing outside claiming Glazier's union store. Maybe  why prices fair. 

Overall shop again. Prices compare favorably Vons Smiths etc. Selection better. sit enjoy beverage snack listen piano. see myself getting all future grocery shopping done here.

This place amazingly HUGE! There's signs outside saying rated Las Vegas's Best Grocery Store figured I'd take look see hype about.

Moldy when opened package! Sad... health department really needs visit unannounced! If East Coast store you. carried many brands New York other eastern areas found chain stores Albertson's Smith's Von's. If wanted some item didn't would order you.

If ever Wegmans back east you'll understand.  Miss having Wegmans.... Anyway always looking carries unique hard finds items.  Maybe missed others but sell Spanish Saffron. Good know if pinch could since usually order saffron off online spice company.  If lived closer would definitely use regular basis. Its large clean store but wasnt impressed produce section. took 5 minutes find tomato wasnt spoiled wilted. Spent same amount time trying find onion wasnt rotten. produce bins huge think may something it. recommendation would reduce size bins rotate stock more keep rotten vegetables sight.

The good meat department very impressed. No changes needed price selection top notch.

If Im over way may just stop again. Besides dudes outside picket line place best. meat fruit vegetable sections best. only buy meat grocery store. Today caught off guard pricing. pricing much lower most other grocery stores. bought bacon today $2.88. am use paying $4 5 per pack. also noticed juices cheaper. purchase Salmon again quality selection awesome. Five stars cause when needed 6 more chicken wings... Yep 6 more chicken wings amazing helped out. first local chain grocery store screwed over selection wings quantity basically less paid for. chain stores sold small packs wings huge packs two people don't need 20 wings... smaller pack screwed...I able call Glazers exactly wanted even stated would proportion wings just amount needed.. AMAZING oh great pricing too. should tried place first. Yep just good everybody says. 

The store inside very neat organized big fan that great friendly staff. wide variety items some things hardly find anywhere else Vegas. 

The salad bar... Oh goodness salad bar. come salad bar alone often. many options. many toppings. Also deli pizza place looks pretty dang good would more willing give them try if am ever mood salad bar. Just clear would never eat any other grocery store's deli section. They're just good love carry Foods can't find Vegas remind back home New York! However grab two pounds cookies today found Vegas driving home eager eat only find stale.  eat different stale. disappointed no longer take chance buying baked goods since bought ovrr $15 worth stale cookies market pretty good pretty good quality meats choose way cheaper Walmart other grocery stores to. donuts fresh each morning if donuts. reasonable prices veggies fruits.  check them if you're area. Durango warmsprings. going little random because gone numerous trips market few years convenience but avoid much possible now. When first started shopping market produce great customer service fabulous. Now every time produce department always filled produce just short going bad. Among trying find produce fresh purchased bundle mini cucumbers literally completely bad rotted within day. also purchased beauty product brought back receipt told couldn't return product. manager reluctant help told could bring back because store policy however no section receipt stating can't bring back beauty products. called general manager see could no return phone call. used place lot before produce department crap managers helpful. only store unless absolutely to. always wanted check Glazier's finally opportunity recently when doing some other shopping neighborhood. 

I tried number pastry items coworkers brought goodies pot lucks other special occasions knew lot offer. walked instantly reminded East coast supermarket. extensive selection East coast goodies both cooked uncooked ethnic foods galore lots healthy organic items. look forward coming back longer shopping list next time. came because told stock all ingredients tiramisu. Everything overpriced mascarpone cheese expired cashier forgot bag cocoa powder! humus bought expired too! Yes forgot check expiration date humus but really? sell ocean perch jays okee doke popcorn ONLY IF YOU'RE Chicago Midwest know am talking ! Lol ONLY store  selling those chips Las Vegas. well ocean Pearch fish love coming store associates very welcoming greets kindness . store seems lil fancy although ritzy area love area community. need more glaziers around Vegas only con best grocery store Las Vegas. shopping many years really don't understand why anyone wastes time money Whole Foods. place such large great selection produce fruit veggies seafood etc. quality everything here. Also amazing resource foods usually only find east coast. very interesting type grocery store. isn't your conventional Smith's even Von's. No carry popular brands mix East coast can't anywhere else. Shall say cheesecake Junior's ? Now don't buy online store experience delicious New York cheesecake thanks them. 

Everything marked pretty well many items going sale your convenience. course am very happy store near place because quite different others. inside deli ice cream store pizza joint sushi stand. also giant wall donuts which help yourself pay counter. 

The background music always touch classical always feel you're blending rich folks P especially when you're wine section! ambiance could better does feel bit old. renovation should happen pretty soon.

Overall wonderful restaurant everyone visit!
